## Relevance to business operations:
Digital activism that directly relates to a firm's products, services, practices, or industry is most likely to matter. This could include:


- Campaigns targeting specific company policies
- Industry-wide movements affecting the business environment
- Consumer boycotts or buycotts


## Reach and virality:

## Number of participants/supporters
Geographic spread
Cross-platform presence
Viral potential


## Stakeholder engagement:
Consider which stakeholders are involved:


Customers
Employees
Investors
Regulators
Media


## Potential business impact:
Assess possible consequences:


## Reputational risks
Financial implications
Regulatory scrutiny
Market share changes


## Longevity and persistence:
Consider the sustainability of the movement:


## One-time event vs. ongoing campaign
Historical context and related movements
Organizational backing


## Alignment with societal trends:

Social justice
Corporate responsibility

## Utilize the label from RavenPack

We first collected the news that are 100% related to public firms. 

## Link the news from RavenPack to LexisNexis

Content matching to get the full news. 


## Set up machine learning to categorize the news into needed categories

For example online versus offline
