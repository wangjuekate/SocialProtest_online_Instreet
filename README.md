Digital and In-street Activism Events

# Goal of this project

## Identify the protest events against public firms in the United States covered by major online and traditional media from 2008 to 2019

## Classify these events into in-street, digital spectator, digital transitional, and digital gladiatorial activities

    Digital activism is a tactic that is defined as activists using digital technologies to present their requests, whereas, in-street activism is a tactic that is defined as activists physically present on the street. 
    
    George and Leidner (2019) have classified digital activism into three types based on their degree of impact:
    
    ## Digital spectator activities
    
    Clicktivism, Metavoicing, Assertion
    
    ## Digital transitional activities
    
    Political consumerism
    Digital petitions
    Botivism
    E-funding
    
    
    ## Digital gladiatorial activities
    
    Data activism
    Exposure
    Hacktivism

    One event can be classified into several categories

- Consumer boycotts or buycotts


## Reach and virality:
Assess the scale and spread of the activist content:


## Number of participants/supporters
Geographic spread
Cross-platform presence
Viral potential


## Stakeholder engagement:
Consider which stakeholders are involved:


Customers
Employees
Investors
Regulators
Media


## Potential business impact:
Assess possible consequences:


## Reputational risks
Financial implications
Regulatory scrutiny
Market share changes


## Longevity and persistence:
Consider the sustainability of the movement:

Assess mainstream and social media attention:


# Sources of Data
LexisNexis, ProQuest, RavenPack

# Steps
## Utilize the label from RavenPack

We first collected the news that are 100% related to public firms. 

## Link the news from RavenPack to LexisNexis

Content matching to get the full news. 


## Set up machine learning to categorize the news into needed categories

For example online versus offline
