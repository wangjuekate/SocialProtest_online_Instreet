They could even discuss their political views and debate the important issues of the day. But what if the government were empowered to determine which political views are appropriate and which are too obscene for the American public?<\/p><p> Well, it looks like this is already happening. Of course, the state has not created a social media network; they didn't have to.It appears the government is using Facebook - the world's largest social media company - tosway[2]public opinion.The Government's Fingers In FacebookThe Free Thought Project recently published areport[3]revealing that Facebook has some troubling ties to the federal government and that this connection could be enabling former state officials to influence the content displayed. The social media provider has partnered with various think tanks which receive state funding,while hiring an alarming number of individuals who have held prominent positions in the federal government. Facebook recently announced theirpartnership[4]with the Atlantic Council - which is partly funded by tax dollars - to ensure that users are presented with quality news stories. And by 'quality,' it seems that they mean 'progressive.' The council is well known for promoting far-left news sources, including the Xinhua News Agency, which was founded by the Communist Party of China. Well, that's reassuring. What red-blooded American capitalistdoesn'twant to get the news from a communist regime? But there one aspect of this story is even more troubling: the government-to-Facebook pipeline.The company has employed a significant number of former officials in positions that grant them influence over what content is allowed on the platform. Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's Head of Cybersecurity Policy, prosecuted cybercrimes at the Department of Justice under President Obama. Now, he is responsible for determining who gets banned or suspended from the network. But that's not the worst of it. He also spearheaded the company's initiative to scrub anti-war content and 'protest' movements.In a blog post, Gleicher wrote: 'Some of the Pages frequently posted about topics like anti-NATO sentiment, protest movements, and anti-corruption.' He continued, 'We are constantly working to detect and stop this type of activity because we don't want our services to be used to manipulate people.' The company has also hired others who served in key positions in the Obama administration. Some of these include:Aneesh Raman: Former speechwriter Joel Benenson: Top adviser Meredith Carden: Office of the First LadyTo make things more interesting, Facebook has also hired neocons to help them determine the type of content that is being published. So if you happen to be a conservative that isn't too crazy about interventionism, your views are not as welcome on the network as others.After all, how many times have you heard of people being banned for posting pro-war or socialist propaganda?Are Private Companies Truly Private?The notion that government officials could be using positions of power in the private industry to advance a statist agenda is disturbing, but the fact that most Americans are unaware of this is far worse.It would be inaccurate to argue that the government is controlling Facebook's content, but the level of the state's involvement in the world's biggest social media company is a disturbing development. This is not the only case of state officials becoming involved with certain industries.This trend is rampant in the certain industries in which individuals move back and forth between private organizations and the FDA. For example, Monsanto, an agricultural and agrochemical company, has been under scrutiny for itsties[5]to the federal government. It is not clear if there is anything that can be done to counteract inappropriate relations between the government and certain companies - especially organizations with the level of influence enjoyed by the likes of Facebook.But it essential that the public is made aware of these relations, otherwise the state will continue to exert influence over society - with Americans none the wiser.

Today, we are pleased to have with us Roberta Jacobson, the Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs. On June 26th through the 29th, she traveled to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. She met with leaders with from all sectors of Central American society to advance our regional partnership for a more secure and prosperous Central America. She will discuss the accomplishments of this trip and review the goals of the Western Hemisphere agenda, and it will then be opened for questions and answers. Thank you.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: All right. Thank you, Jean, and good afternoon. Its nice to see everybody again. I am relatively recently back from Central America, and I wanted to start off talking a little bit about that, about the trip, and about some of the things I saw and put it in a little bit of context, and then we can open it up to whatever everyone would like to talk about.<\/p><p>So let me start off saying that it had been about a year and a half since I had been to Central America, and so it seemed like a good idea to get back there. Obviously, this is a big focus for us, especially in our security programs, and the Central American Regional Security Program is obviously an integral part of all four of our interlocking security citizen security initiatives: the Merida Initiative in Mexico, Central American Regional Security Initiative, the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, and the Colombia Strategic Development Initiative. So it was important for me to get back to talking with some of our Central American partners.<\/p><p>I think overall one of the things that you see in Central America, which is a hallmark of what were doing around the hemisphere, really is the two areas in particular, one, that the engagement on security issues goes well beyond law enforcement and just the police or military side of security. When we talk about working with partners in the hemisphere on citizen security issues, were talking about an integrated approach to citizen security that spans the gamut, and Im going to talk about that again in a minute.<\/p><p>But the other thing I wanted to mention was it was very important to me that I highlight something that the Secretary has talked about a great deal, Secretary Clinton, which is the importance of civil society. One of the things the Secretary has said she said it at the Summit of the Americas in talking with the civil society forum, but she has repeated it since is that for us our foreign policy really does have three legs in this stool. And those legs are government and we obviously undertake a lot of government-to-government interaction the private sector and the business community, and civil society writ large. And I felt that I had had a pretty good opportunity over the last year or so to interact with governmental counterparts, and obviously I was going to do some of that on this trip, but that it was most important for me to make sure that I touch base with civil society activists because that is the sense that you cant really get in Washington. That is the value added of traveling. So that was an emphasis of the trip.<\/p><p>Since 2008, I think most of you know, the Central American Regional Security Initiative we have appropriated and disbursed close to $500 million of assistance in Central America, with the considerable amount of our focus on the three northern triangle countries: El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, which were the three that I visited. Those span the range of this integrated approach, as I mentioned, which really does run from police and security, law enforcement activity, to prosecutors, judges, public defenders, working with judicial systems, alternative dispute resolution, and onto efforts that were making in communities to strengthen communities to withstand the impact of transnational crime. And thats why over 90 percent of our assistance, bilateral assistance in Central America, is focused on core development issues health, education, issues like support for civil society and economic growth.<\/p><p>So I traveled to the three countries in that order, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. And two of the things that I think were most exciting for me were events that I was able to hold focusing on education and youth. In El Salvador, I was privileged to hand out 49 micro scholarships as part of our SEMILLA or SEED program. This has been in effect for many years, but weve amplified it more recently. The recipients were 50 percent female and all students that came from rural areas, students who might otherwise never have had an opportunity to go to the United States and study. And what was just as exciting as meeting the students who are going to study education, healthcare, small business development what was just as exciting was meeting their families, people who had traveled pretty long distances to be there for this celebration of their childrens success, and I thought that was terrific. We also had the privilege of having one of the alumni of the program with us who is a two-term mayor in La Union, of a community in La Union, and former governor, who was a participant in this SEED program when he was in high school. They will be studying at community colleges across the United States.<\/p><p>In Guatemala, I had the opportunity to go to Coban and to visit with students in our Access English program. What some folks may not know is that the Access English program in Guatemala is the largest in the hemisphere with 1,400 students, over 700 alumni, which is a little bit surprising, I think, to many people. But these kids were just remarkable. They are incredible students of English. They were very proud of what they had done. A number of the advanced students were serving as translators and interpreters for a U.S.-Guatemalan military humanitarian exercise that was underway called Beyond the Horizon, which I also visited. And they are serving with the medics, translating not from Spanish to English but from Kiche to English. And so they were just performing these invaluable services as a result of being able to take these classes in English for a number of months. And they were just remarkable and very enthusiastic about their work. So those were two of the things that I did.<\/p><p>In Guatemala, El Salvador, and in Honduras I also met with groups of civil society, human rights, nongovernmental organizations, those working in labor, working on legal reforms. And the group that I met with that was the largest was in El Salvador, but in Guatemala and Honduras I also got a very good representation of civil society. In Honduras, that included meeting with leaders of the Alliance for Peace and Justice, which is about a three-month-old civil society consortium, which I was very impressed with, impressed with their work and impressed with their enthusiasm, including Julieta Castellanos, the rector of the University in Honduras whose son was tragically killed last year.<\/p><p>In all three places, I think one of the things that left me optimistic was the fact that there were such vibrant civil society organizations engaged, doing their own work, working in communities, gathering their own statistics, challenging the government on occasion, but also working with them to try and create safer communities.<\/p><p>The other thing that impressed me was we know from statistics that communities in which we work with municipal governments, especially USAIDs programs on prevention and on economic opportunity, those communities have seen marked decreases in crime. But one of the things that impressed me the most in El Salvador was so have communities in which we are not necessarily working, but community leaders themselves are working to organize some of those same efforts. And so it really underscored the belief that you cannot fight crime without the engagement and involvement of the community and without creating some opportunities, especially for young people.<\/p><p>The other things, I had meetings in all three countries, obviously, with government leaders. In Honduras, there was a SICA meeting that was taking place, and that was the reason part of the reason that I was there. It was very exciting for me to be there for the first time as a formal observer to SICA, since the U.S. and I signed those papers a couple of months ago. The SICA meeting, as you may know, had a little bit of turbulence in one of the agreements that was being signed within SICA with Panama, but it really went very well in the end. We were able to make the statement about the importance of regional efforts and that no country can do this alone. Our programs are premised on regional cooperation to combat transnational crime.<\/p><p>But the other thing I thought was very exciting was that the SICA countries were able to sign the agreement with the EU, which was there to do so, which reinforces, I think, those of us who were members of the Friends of Central America group, remaining engaged and working together to coordinate our assistance in that part of the world.<\/p><p>So I left Central America, I think, frankly, slightly more optimistic than Ive been in a while. I think this is a very long, hard slog that is going to take quite a while, because fundamentally, the efforts against transnational crime can only be combated by stronger democratic institutions, institutions like the police and military, institutions like the judiciary, institutions like the fiscales (ph), institutions in communities. And so that is a long-term project and not one that were going to see turn around immediately. But I think people are starting to know what works and starting to replicate it, and I also think weve seen very important movement forward over the last year or two by governments to create the structures and the legal frameworks, the policy agenda that makes success possible, which is certainly a very important first step. There is still a ways to go.<\/p><p>But I also came back very encouraged by what were doing with young people. The best part of my job and I said this while I was there the best part of my job is the engagement with young people on educational issues, because that it sounds like sort of kumbaya and clich, but that actually is the way we ensure that things get better in the future. So I was very encouraged by that.<\/p><p>And I will leave you finally with a reiteration of the importance of institutions. I was listening to Fernando Henrique Cardoso over the last two days and last night when he won the Kluge Prize at the Library of Congress, which is a $1 million prize for his academic study of humanity. And he talked about a phrase that we have seen elsewhere, but I really like it in this context, which is the infrastructure of hope. And in the end, the infrastructure of hope, what it means is democratic institutions that can withstand corruption, that can withstand transnational crime, that can withstand abuse, and thats what were trying to construct with our partners in Central America. So let me stop there and open things up.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. So first question, well go right here. Just wait for the microphone and state your name and<\/p><p>QUESTION: Jesus Esquivel from Proceso Magazine. Roberta, I have two questions for you one on Central America and the other on Mexico. The President-elect of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, has said hes going to change the strategy in the war on drugs, especially with the relation of the United States. He wants to demilitarize the strategy, and second, he says hes going to concentrate more on the issue of security for the Mexican people. And he says the measure of success is not on the number of confiscation of drugs and the arrest of the capos in Mexico.<\/p><p>My question to in this regard is: Is the U.S. Government worried about it? You know very well the issue of narcotics in Mexico, and that will probably increase the number of drugs crossing the border if hes going to do exactly what hes saying. Are you guys worried about it? I know youre going to say, We are ready to work with him, but the State Department already said that.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Youre answering your own question, Jesus. (Laughter.)<\/p><p>QUESTION: Well, but Roberta, we need more<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Its a fair question.<\/p><p>QUESTION: We need more specific answer to that. And the second is on Central America. He also said that one of his priorities will be working with Central America and trying to include Brazil on that. And he says the Merida Initiative is not working as it was planned on Central America. So he says he want to have more hemisphere approach to the problem of the security and international crime in Central America. Whats your position on that?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Okay. Thanks. I appreciate that, and let me start with the first question. Im not going to surprise you. Im not worried. And part of the reason Im not worried is because I think weve certainly watched and listened to everything that Enrique Pena Nieto has said before the election and now since the election, and youre right, Im going to say that we look forward to working with him, which we do.<\/p><p>But its also true that I have seen nothing in anything he has said that gives me cause for concern. The notion that somebody wants to re-look at a strategy and possibly make changes I think is not only to be expected but a healthy thing. Strategies get put into place to respond to a moment in time and hopefully move you forward, right, in the fight against transnational organized crime. But they also have to be adaptable. They have to shift and change, because we know that the criminal organizations shift and change.<\/p><p>We also know, and I would say much more broadly, that the notion that you want to go from whats your measure of success is it drugs interdicted, is it rates of homicide or violence I have always said, and I think we have said from the beginning with the Merida Initiative, that there are many multiple metrics that you can use and that clearly the level of violence in Mexico is unacceptable to Mexicans and it should be unacceptable to all of us. And so the fact that that is an important metric for the President-elect, I think is entirely logical. I dont think it necessarily means there will be less drugs interdicted. I dont know exactly what changes to the strategy the new President may make and what those changes what effect those changes will have on the cartels. I think well have to wait and see. But its a very productive conversation to have. And it is clearly one of the things you hear from all over the region, is that the level of violence is too high, that that has to go down. Its why we have seen changes in the way that people approach this problem. Its why you see changes like the truce that was brokered in El Salvador with the gangs. There is a real desire to lower that level of violence that is entirely understandable.<\/p><p>But I would also say that when you talk about Central America and where Mexico may shift or emphasize engagement with Central America, I think thats incredibly encouraging. I think thats exactly the right message, which is that we all have to be working better together, that Mexico has an enormous amount to contribute even while it is confronting these problems at home, but that there are others in the hemisphere who have something that they can bring to the table to support efforts in Central America. Weve seen that already, quite frankly, very actively and very positively with Colombia, in Central America, and with Chile, already engaging with those countries on ways of doing business and ways of combating corruption and criminal activity that have been successful and can be modeled or replicated or adjusted for Central America.<\/p><p>The notion of whether Brazil can also play a role on that, I think is a very positive conversation to have. I think certainly the Brazilians have capabilities and have experience that can be useful, and we think the more partners from within the hemisphere that can help in Central America, the better.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. For our next question, well go in the front here to Sonia.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi. Thank you. My name is Sonia Schott. I am with Globovision, Venezuela. Heavyweight Republicans have criticized the politics towards the political strategy towards Venezuela. I was wondering if you have any comments on that, if you agreed on that, because it seems to be that the bilateral relations are in a freeze point. It is because the electoral year, not only here but in Venezuela, and that makes me go to my second question. You have repeatedly asked for a transparent process, electoral process in Venezuela. What did that mean? What will need to happen in Venezuela in order for you to recognize it was a transparent electoral process? Does it has to do with the electoral missions? Thank you.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thank you. I appreciate that. I think it probably will not surprise you that I disagree with the notion that we do not have a good policy on Venezuela. I think the thing about our policy on Venezuela is and I would argue that, yes, we are both in electoral years; yes, electoral years in every country in the world make international relations more complicated because domestic politics takes precedence in many ways. But I would argue to you that the relationship that we have with Venezuela, if indeed its frozen and I dont disagree that it is not as productive as it could be right now but that that started before certainly before our electoral calendar really picked up, and it was independent of that. And frankly, it is disappointing to us because we are willing to and happy to engage on practical issues where we can cooperate or we may see things the same way. But we have not had that reciprocated from the Venezuelan Government, and thats unfortunate.<\/p><p>We also obviously would like to be able to cooperate on issues of regional importance, but that has not been possible because the Venezuelan Government has not seemed eager to do that, to work with us, as opposed to speaking, in the rhetorical sense certainly, against some of the United States initiatives and some of our efforts. So that is disappointing to us. And we remain ready to have that more productive relationship, but not willing to do anything more than extend that hand. And if it is not reciprocated, then we arent willing to take that any further. Its just not productive.<\/p><p>Let me also say, though, that on the elections, I think there are very clear ways in which Venezuela can ensure that the international community at large not just the United States, which frankly is not necessarily the arbiter here, it is the international community at large can have confidence in the results. And the way to do that is to welcome in observers. And so we hope that that will be the case, that Venezuela will welcome in observers, whether from the EU or the OAS. I think that would make a very large difference in the confidence that those in the international community have in the results.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. For our next question, well go to New York.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Yes. Hello. I am Ana Baron from Clarin of Argentina. Thank you very much for this press conference. I have two questions on Argentina. First of all, while we know that trade restrictions was one of the subjects you discussed on your last trip to Argentina, so I wanted to know since then there was the United States complaint in the WTO. Now Argentina, some time ago some minutes ago, hours ago has presented a complaint against the lemons and meat restrictions in U.S. market. So I wanted to know if we are assisting to a little trade war between the two countries.<\/p><p>And second, I have a question of narco-trafficking. You were talking a lot about narco-trafficking in Central America. Since the plane the military plane was detained in Ezeiza, it seems that the cooperation between the two countries has diminished significantly. I wanted to know if this is a subject that worries and if you see some prospective of ameliorating the relationship at this on this subject.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thank you. I think on the first point, on the trade issues, it certainly wasnt the central part central component of my visit there. Im not a trade expert for the U.S. Government. But I certainly did have conversations, and we continue, obviously, as you note, in these movements more recently to continue to have conversations with Argentina about concerns that we have, whether on specific trade issues or on import restrictions and other things that U.S. companies are finding difficult in Argentina. We continue again to look for a way that we can cooperate on these issues, but we do think that there are international rules and regulations that we all have to abide by. And its one of the reasons why the WTO is there, why organizations like ICSID or SIAVE (ph)*, the organization to arbitrate financial disputes. What we believe in is a rules-based system in which folks actually comply with the rules, which we will do when the decisions go against us and we hope other countries will do when decisions go against them.<\/p><p>So were still trying to work through all of these issues, but I will say that there is a desire on both parties sides, I think certainly speaking for the United States Government to try and resolve those issues in as productive a way as we can, and to try and recognize that we have lots of other components of a bilateral relationship that can move ahead. And we want to be sure that while we work on those economic, commercial, or trade problems that we may have in the relationship, they do not, frankly, bleed into other areas of the relationship where we have a more positive engagement and we are able to move forward.<\/p><p>When I was in Argentina in February, two of the things that I worked on and that I think that Im particularly excited about are moving forward on educational exchanges, which, frankly, are pretty low between Argentina and the United States. I think theres head room there, room to grow.<\/p><p>And so weve moved forward with an agreement with the Argentine Government on some additional scholarships and pushing up those numbers. And I had a meeting with 13 rectors of universities that was very productive, as well as with the Minister of Education. But we also signed a sister parks agreement for our national parks, which I think is also very important, and was very impressed by the Argentine presentation on that.<\/p><p>In following up on that, we now have we had the NASA administrator who went to Argentina. And we have Tecnopolis, I think opening this week perhaps in Argentina, with an exhibit from the United States. So theres lots of other areas in which we can cooperate.<\/p><p>Getting to your second question because I think it relates, obviously cooperating on narcotics is one of those areas where I think that we should still be able to work together regardless of other problems. And its also true that cooperation on security issues, in particular narcotics\/counternarcotics efforts, was clearly set back by the incident last year. I am pretty optimistic that were going to be able to move ahead on a cooperative agenda on narcotics issues. I think there is a desire on the part of the Argentine Government to move ahead on that, and I certainly will confirm that there is a strong desire on our part.<\/p><p>So Im more optimistic probably even than I was when I was in Argentina four or five months ago that we can move ahead on that productively.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Great. For our next question well go in the front right here.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Jacobson. This is Tomas Guevara, the editor of El Diario de Hoy, Salvador. When you visited recently El Salvador, the countrys in a serious political crisis now. What do you think about that situation between the conflict with the national assembly, with the supreme court, and how it can impact the relationship with the U.S.?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I think its an incredibly important question, and I was struck obviously by that dispute between the assembly and the court when I was in El Salvador. And I obviously spoke with a lot of people about it to learn as much as I could, to hear from folks on the ground what they saw as the prospects for resolution. And this was I was there just before July 1. Now weve passed that July 1 date, and so in some respects the issue has gotten even more acute.<\/p><p>And I would say this does concern us very greatly. This is clearly something that Salvadorans have to resolve, that we have said clearly, both I have said it in El Salvador but our Ambassador and we were all thrilled to have Mari Carmen Aponte back in San Salvador as our Ambassador has said publicly that we really do urge in the strongest terms possible that the two sides of this dispute really try and come together and resolve it. And I think thats important. It is a Salvadoran dispute to resolve; it is not ours to opine on how it gets resolved. We would just like to see it resolved.<\/p><p>But I will say that there are some issues that are important to us that engage the court or the national assembly, and those things are being, frankly, held up by this dispute. The question of extraditions, which there are a number of extraditions pending, and we think its important that extraditions be part of not the only available tool but part of the tool kit that governments be able to use to fight transnational crime. Those may not move ahead while this dispute simmers.<\/p><p>There is discussion in El Salvador, I certainly heard from all sides, of new investment laws and things that need to move ahead in the national assembly, which would be very important and very, I think, beneficial for the Partnership for Growth effort that were undertaking with El Salvador and the efforts that were trying to make to move ahead on economic development. If those things get slowed down by this dispute, then thats a problem that really affects more than just El Salvador, unfortunately.<\/p><p>QUESTION: A follow-up?<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Sure. A follow-up.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi. This is Luis Alonso. Are you concerned with the stability of the President Funes Government? Because of this dispute, is there a state of rule of law in danger by this dispute?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I confess to you, I have seen lots of breathless commentary about this. And theres no doubt in my mind that this is a serious concern and a serious problem that needs to be worked out, but I have absolutely no concerns about the stability of the Funes Government and its sort of democracy surviving in El Salvador. This is a dispute between two branches of government. I have every confidence that Salvadorans from the various branches of government will resolve this is an amicable and legal and constitutional way, and that overall the democratic health of El Salvador will not suffer for it.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. The next question well go here and then to Denise after.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Santiago Tavara from Notimex. Do you have any update on the in Honduras the recent incidents, two incidents that involved DEA agents? And about the first incident, I think Spokesperson Victoria Nuland told us that she would release a report in the next weeks. I dont know if you have a date. And also, the second question is on Peru regarding human rights abuses reported against people who are protesting against gold mine<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Conga.<\/p><p>QUESTION: -- a proposed mine in Peru from the U.S.-based Newmont Mining Corporation. I dont know if you have any reaction.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Well, let me start on Honduras. Obviously, weve been in engaged with in support of the Honduran Government in operations against narcotics trafficking in northern Honduras, coastal Honduras, in the last number of months. In those operations, over two and a half tons of cocaine was seized in two-plus just over two months, which is an extraordinary record. I want to say clearly from the outset that in the first incident and Im not sure which first or second were talking about, but May 11th, in which it would appear from the reports that weve seen certainly from the preliminary reports that four people were killed. And that is never what you want to happen, and we regret that greatly. That was an incident in which it was not the DEA but Hondurans who were firing guns and fired upon.<\/p><p>But in all of these incidents, I think we have to wait until the investigations and the reviews are concluded. What we will do as things proceed is we will obviously be reviewing with our Honduran counterparts exactly what the operations how they worked, what worked well, what didnt work well, how can we avoid, obviously, any deaths in the future.<\/p><p>And I will also say that in the second two incidents, which were ones in which DEA did unfortunately the DEA agents did unfortunately kill those who were trafficking drugs, we do expect, frankly, that those actually doing the trafficking will resist losing their cargo and being arrested. And unfortunately, it is a very dangerous game. What we want to try and ensure with our Honduran partners is that nobody who is not involved in narco-trafficking is wounded or killed as a consequence of these operations.<\/p><p>But I think that it does reinforce the importance of that area physically, geographically, in terms of the root of cocaine up north towards the United States. And we have seen lots of indications polls taken in Honduras of support for our continued engagement, and the government has made clear that they would like the United States to remain engaged in that support and training role.<\/p><p>The second question was on Peru and reports of human rights abuses to those protesting. Its the Conga Mine, I assume. And to be honest with you, Ive seen some of the press reports, but I dont have any independent information on that. Obviously, its always worrisome when you have a situation in which there is violence, in which protest is not carried out peacefully. And what we would like to see and obviously in support of the Peruvian Government, its not a role for us is a resolution to the very difficult situation that has emerged between the community and the mining company. And I think the Peruvian Government is trying to resolve that as best they can.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Im Denise Chrispim Marim from O Estado de Sao Paolo, Brazil. Thank you very much for this opportunity. We were waiting for a long time for this.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Im sorry. (Laughter.)<\/p><p>QUESTION: Well, I wonder (inaudible) and I wanted to ask you what is exactly the position of United States in the case of the crisis in Paraguay, particularly if you how is your assessment on the sanctions that has already been imposed against Paraguay by regional organizations? And how could be the best approach of OAS in this case?<\/p><p>Secondly, if you dont mind<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: That was all the first? Wasnt that like three parts?<\/p><p>QUESTION: No, it is you know that there is a lot of talks and speculations on a meeting between military American militarys and Paraguayan officials in Asuncion last days. And there is some speculations on the interest of America to build a military base in Paraguay. I wonder to know if you are aware about this information and if it is really a desire of United States.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Okay, let me start out with that second part, because I want to be very, very clear about this. I have no information about U.S. military meeting with Paraguayan counterparts or officials in recent days. So Im not sure what thats referring to.<\/p><p>We have no desire no desire, let me be clear about this to do anything in Paraguay that isnt either requested by the Paraguayan Government or an event, an occasion, a training, an engagement that is a partnership with Paraguay. And we have no interest in promoting a base or military presence in Paraguay separate or apart from sort of our normal interaction with the Paraguayans on counternarcotics issues, on training issues, on counterterrorism. We have engaged in that kind of cooperation very transparently for years, and we hope to continue to do that. That is very different than this notion of building bases, which I really want to dispel, because it does keep coming up, which I find somewhat bizarre.<\/p><p>The other thing I want to be clear about is that we are not only transparent about what our interests and our opportunities or engagement is with the Paraguayans to the public, to our own officials, to the Congress, but to anybody else in the region whos interested. And obviously weve had conversations with our Brazilian counterparts on what each of us are doing cooperatively with Paraguay, and so that there will never be surprises in that area.<\/p><p>On the crisis in Paraguay, I think one of the things that I think is important is the report of the OAS was presented to the Permanent Council yesterday, I guess, and we were obviously very pleased to be part of that mission. The mission was made up of the U.S., Mexican, Canadian, Haitian, and Honduran ambassadors to the OAS plus the Secretary General and I think one or two of his staff. I think that that mission really got a huge spectrum of opinions while they were there all of the branches of government, President Lugo and members of his cabinet, and so meeting with President Franco and folks from his cabinet and other organizations. So I think that was a very, very important step for the OAS to take because I do think that there were conversations that needed to take place about why things happened the way they did and what justification there was for things that hadnt really taken place. So I think that that was a very important first step, and we strongly support the Secretary General in that mission. That was certainly clear by our sending our ambassador. And we continue to support his efforts and think the report is really quite well done.<\/p><p>As we look forward because I think that what we really want to do is focus on the future and what assistance Paraguay may ask for and need from the OAS in terms of preparations for elections, dialogue on issues that are still of concern and creating tension, moving ahead to ensure that in this transition period, Paraguay gets ready for exemplary elections in April of 2013. And I think in that respect, we have an enormous amount in common with all of our regional partners who I think also want to look ahead and cooperate in helping Paraguay get to that point.<\/p><p>In terms of what sub-regional organizations may have done, sanctions or suspensions, I think thats for them to comment on. Weve been very comfortable with where the OAS is on this, and we think its an excellent forum for continued engagement.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Follow-up? (Laughter.)<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Well go to the follow-up and then to your question or is it a follow-up as well?<\/p><p>QUESTION: No, its a follow-up, but about another issue. So we can follow up this one.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. (Laughter.) So you pick.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Rock, paper, scissor.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi. Yes. Youve said that the report by the Secretary General of the OAS was quite well done. I wanted to know what your assessment is, what your opinion is, on his concrete proposals to send a mission to Paraguay until the elections, and also if you think that, as he said, that its not a constructive step to suspend Paraguay from the organization.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Name your media organization?<\/p><p>QUESTION: Its EFE.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I will give you the short answer to that as yes on both questions. The only thing I would add is I think the report is very well done. I think the notion of sending a mission, sending technical experts and that could change. It depends on what Paraguayans feel they need or what the skills are that is needed at the time. And as you get closer to election, different kinds of skills are needed. But I think the notion of having the OAS remain engaged with a mission in Paraguay is a very good one, a very positive one that I think would be helpful I believe and I hope for Paraguay and for all of the rest of us trying to sort of grapple with the issue. And I think that hes right, that at this point there really doesnt appear to be a reason to suspend Paraguay from the OAS.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: So now to your follow-up question.<\/p><p>QUESTION: So thank you for doing this. I am Silvia Pisani from La Nacion in Argentina. Also, so first, I would like to ask you a very specific follow-up in the first question about Argentina, and then I will jump into another line. But the follow up is: Also, I saw some concern in the United States about a specific point of the currency exchange policy in Argentina, regarding the possibility of buying dollars. And this was affecting the American enterprises to their imports because they cant buy the dollars that they need to import.<\/p><p>And also, its beginning to now, its beginning to generate some fear in the population of the possibility of traveling abroad. So I would like to ask you if you still have those concerns and if you specifically raised them to the Argentinean Government, and if that is the case, if you received any answer about that. Thats the first point.<\/p><p>And jumping in another line, I would like to ask you: I have been seeing in the Congress particularly some concern about the freedom of expression and the freedom of press in Argentina. I would like to ask your opinion about that. Thank you.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Okay. Thank you. What I can tell you in terms of the currency issue or the ability of, in particular, U.S. businesses to operate and be able to get currency out of the country, for example, which is one of the things I heard a great deal about when I was in Argentina in February, one of the difficulties that some of our companies are having is that for many of them, it may not be that difficult because theyre not they dont operate with huge amounts of cash. For certain sectors and I think you can probably figure out which ones; it may be airlines, it may be others but for certain sectors who get a lot of revenue in cash, if you will, they have difficulties. And some of these restrictions were making things difficult for them. And so what we had asked at the time was that the Government of Argentina look at the impact of some of these restrictions, which are very broad, on particular sectors which maybe have more acute difficulty with them. And so thats a continuing discussion that were having with the Argentine Government.<\/p><p>On freedom of expression, I guess I should say: We have talked a lot about this over the last year or so. Weve talked about our concerns for journalists in the hemisphere all of you, every day, know this for your brothers and sisters working in countries throughout the hemisphere, we see with a great deal of, I think the word is just sadness and anguish, when international organizations put out statements about this region being the most dangerous for journalists. I mean, that is really sometimes shocking to us. And that danger, obviously, has come from different quarters. And its come ferociously from organized crime, frankly. But there have been other threats to journalists work not to their lives, let me be clear, but to their work and to the freedom of expression that has been mounted by governments. Whether its lawsuits, whether it is withdrawal of revenue or advertisement, whether it is shutting things down, there are threats that confront journalists. And that it seems to us really critically important as part of democracy in the hemisphere. A free press is not optional. Its an integral part of democracy in the hemisphere.<\/p><p>Now, I think you would probably agree that in Argentina we certainly could not say that there is not an opposing view in the press to that of the government. There is certainly a healthy, open, exchange in the press. But I do think its important that we continue to press to ensure that governments understand that you really dont want to start down the slippery slope of trying to reduce the amount of freedom and ability to get their message out, the news out, the information out, because it can be a slippery slope, and thats very, very frightening for all of us.<\/p><p>I should say that I think there are lots of new ways of getting information, and so when people talk about press freedom and media ownership in the hemisphere as being too concentrated or its only one view of the situation in a particular country, it seems to us that the answer to that is essentially further democratization of media and press, which becomes easier in our digital and social media age, not a narrowing of that voice.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. Well go to Jose and then in the front here.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. Thank you for doing this really. Jose Diaz-Briseno with Reforma from Mexico. When talking about the understandable, well, a concern in Mexico to lower the violence, specifically the homicide rate, you mentioned the truce of murders in El Salvador. Do you think thats a model that could be feasible and desirable in Mexico between the cartels?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I think that every case is different. And I think that truces have to be seen and this is what I have certainly heard from experts on this subject, and I am not one of them. I will preface with that. But I have certainly heard from experts on this that the one thing you have to be sure of is that truces ceasefires, as theyre often called in the United States; ceasefire Chicago, Boston has tried some of these theyre never a permanent answer, right? So they are at best, even where they work and they dont always work they are at best a temporary measure while you put into place more structural and institutional changes to reduce either violence or drug trafficking or homicide or whatever or gang activity.<\/p><p>And so I think one of the things that we need to be a little bit careful of is the notion that a truce is what we all continue to look for, sort of the magic bullet, the single thing you can do that will solve this problem. And I think some of this the structure of organized crime and narcotics trafficking I think is significantly different than gang activity. And so I think both the multiplicity of players and the trade that theyre in make it much more complicated and much less likely that is a productive tool in that particular setting. But I think thats something that obviously people look at all the time, both academics and practitioners.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi, again. Just to going back to Paraguay, just want to make sure that the assessment on whether or not the impeachment of President Lugo is a coup detat has been finished. Have you guys reached a conclusion, like the OAS expressed yesterday, or youre still assessing the --<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Well, I think what I would say is that the OAS and what the Secretary General set out in his report makes a lot of sense to us. The Secretary General talked about concerns over the rapidity or the speed of the process. We have expressed those concerns publicly. But he also talked about the constitution in Paraguay and what it provides for. And so he is striking that balance between a process that may have seemed too rapid but also is set out in their constitution. And so I think the most important thing we support his report, and the most important thing at this point is to look for constructive ways moving forward to engage with the Paraguayans, including with the Franco government, to get to the elections next year.<\/p><p>QUESTION: So it was not a coup detat?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Im not going to answer that question, Luis.<\/p><p>QUESTION: (Inaudible.)<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thats the implication of what I said, that may be.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. Silvia Ayuso from the German Press Agency. My question is related to Cuba. There are increasing reports, rumors, nothing yet still confirmed about a possible outbreak of cholera even that might have reached even Havana. I was wondering if you have some information, and would that be the case? Would that affect some kind of I mean, the travels to the island what could be done in this respect from the U.S.?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Let me just say that its my understanding actually that Cuba has made a statement that there is cholera but that its under control in eastern part of Cuba. And so at this point, frankly, what we know is what weve seen as the press, as all of you have. I will say that obviously if there has been an outbreak of cholera, whether its under control or not, these this is the kind of information that we often put into I dont know that we will, but we often put into our Consular Information Sheets or Travel Warnings where they exist to make sure that Americans know about that possibility. But I dont know that thats been done yet or will need to be done. Well have to see how this develops.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Next question here, and then to you.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you very much. Im Lina Correa from Voice of America, also in Cuba. A few weeks ago the State Department asked for a humanitarian act in the case of Alan Gross. Have you received any answer from the Cuban Government about that? And also, how can the public opinion in United States value that U.S. policy with regard to Cuba when we cannot see any sign of change there?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Well, I think on the first question, on Alan Gross, youre quite right. We have actually repeatedly made a request of the Cuban Government to release Alan Gross on a humanitarian basis to be home with his family, to see his 90-year-old mother whos dying of cancer, and to attend to his own health issues. And no, we have not gotten an acceptable response at this point. And obviously he is not home with his family, so that has not occurred. Despite the fact that Mr. Gonzalez was permitted by the court to see his brother, who was ill, we have not gotten that kind of action from the Cuban Government on Mr. Grosss case.<\/p><p>On the issue of change in Cuba, I think one of the things that is always hard to judge is it is difficult for us sometimes to understand, where there may be change, how much change there may be. We obviously cant venture very far outside Havana very often, and that makes it difficult for us to know what may be happening in other parts of the country. There are a lot of economic changes that have been announced, that have been talked about, that have been rumored, but not as much thats actually been implemented and thats being seen, I think, on the ground and in peoples lives.<\/p><p>But I think its interesting, when you see Raul Castro going to VietnamVietnam, which is a country which has made significant changes and with which we obviously want to see even further changes on the political side, but economic changes have already been made there is no doubt, it seems to me, that there is continued discussion and studying and interest in changes in Cuba.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, we have not seen any conversation from the governments side of political changes. Lots of conversation about economic changes that may or may not make a huge difference in peoples lives, but no changes in the ability of people to express themselves freely, to organize into political parties, et cetera. And that I mean, that does not change our policy, nor do I think it denigrates it any way. But what it does mean, I think, is that continuing the people-to-people contact that we have had, the changes that this President made to the regulations both on travel and on remittances with Cuba, are important ones to try and engage with the Cuban people in the absence of our ability to engage and see change in the Cuban Government.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: We have time for one or two more questions. Well start here.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thanks. Martha Avila from RCN TV, Colombia. Whats your opinion about the security in Colombia today? In the last days, the FARC has increased the terrorist attacks in the country. How see the U.S. Government the situation? The security in Colombia is worse?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I dont think that thats a conclusion that I would draw yet at this point, and I certainly hope its one that I wont be drawing. We certainly have seen those attacks and we are concerned about them, and we obviously deplore the violence. I want to actually make just a side comment because I failed to mention it when Jose and I were talking. I want to also reject the violence against El Norte in Monterrey, against a newspaper there.<\/p><p>But in the case of the FARC in Colombia, I think that its very clear that that is not the way forward, that the government will handle these issues and handle them well. We have confidence in the Government of Colombia. But I dont think that anyone can yet draw a conclusion that security is worse in Colombia. And I certainly hope that will not be the case and that the FARC will not return to acts of violence such as they committed in the past, which obviously we deplored and continue to. And thats not the way ahead in Colombia.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi. Im Luciana Coelho, Folha de Sao Paulo, Brazil. Just to bring back to the OAS a little bit, there are some concern from a group of NGOs and even within the OAS that there are a group of countries organized to kind of, Id say, deflate the system and the OAS and its importance. And Brazil is in its group, and also Ecuador and others. So the situation in Paraguay and the divisions within the member countries since supposed risk of exacerbation of this movement. Id like to know if the U.S. is paying any attention to that, if there is any concern, and if you see that this could harm the inter-American system.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thank you for the question. I actually I think many of you may have seen some of the comments that I made, that our delegation made, and some of the things that were said at the OAS General Assembly in Cochabamba. In particular, the OAS the inter-American system on human rights came under just fierce attack, I mean just the fiercest Ive ever seen. And that is something that worries us enormously.<\/p><p>The heart in some respects, the heart of the Organization of American States and the thing that, in my opinion, it should be most proud of is the inter-American system on human rights the commission, the court, all of the processes that have been developed over the years. You may take issue with individual decisions. The United States is brought before the commission more than any other country in the hemisphere, and we very often dont agree with the decisions. But we will defend the commission and its right to act forever, because the system is not designed for a particular case. It is not designed for a particular government. Its designed to protect the constellation of rights and democratic freedoms that we have all agreed to against any kind of incursion. And sometimes those decisions are difficult for countries. But the discomfort is the price we pay for a system that defends all of us at various times and has defended very important issues of human rights in the last 40 years in this hemisphere.<\/p><p>So I think that the OAS General Assembly was of I mean, the conversations that we held there, I think, were of great concern to us. And moving forward, we want to find ways to strengthen and yes, reform, in part the inter-American human rights system, but not to destroy it.<\/p><p>And I will say I just want to be clear about this that unfortunately, it became clear at the General Assembly that some peoples goals wasnt reform. In fact, they didnt even use the words reform. They used the words destruction. And that to me it wasnt me interpreting those words; it was what was said. So having that out on the table, maybe now we can talk about how to reform the system and in fact continue to strengthen it, even when we dont like its decisions all the time, as will happen.<\/p><p>I do think that moving ahead on the issue of Paraguay, we have an opportunity here in the hemisphere. We have an opportunity to work together on an issue that concerns all of us, which is strengthening democracy and strengthening dialogue in Paraguay. I think the way the OAS has gone about this has been very healthy and very productive, but I think there are important roles for countries in South America. And we will continue to work, for example, with Brazil on this issue very closely. We will continue to be in contact with our colleagues in Chile, in Colombia, in Peru. All of those countries are important to moving this ahead and finding a constructive outcome, which I think everybody wants. We have had good conversations with our Uruguayan counterparts.<\/p><p>So I dont I see Paraguay in some ways as a way for us to come together as a region to support Paraguayan democracy, not as an issue which will exacerbate divisions.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Could you expand your comment regarding the attacks against El Norte, if possible?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Right. I mean, the only thing I want to say about that is we have seen, obviously, violence against journalists, individual journalists, but also against newspapers or other media outlets in Mexico in the past. These attacks just unfortunately sort of continue or take that to another level, and they have to be rejected by everyone. And one of the things that worries me the most in Mexico is the threat of physical violence, which causes both, obviously, an inability to report stories just because of physical harm but also leads to self-censorship, if were not careful, because of fear, a climate of fear.<\/p><p>And so I think that we all have to stand up and speak out against that kind of violence and hope to work with the government, because I think the current government has made it very clear that they dont accept those kinds of attacks and that they want to work on resolving those cases and reducing the incidents of violence against journalists and media outlets, and that well do everything we can to help in that area.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Im afraid were out of time. I want to thank Assistant Secretary Jacobson for coming here.

We have a broad political context at the moment where there is political pressure to wind back or draw down that right to peaceful protest.\" \"The (right to peaceful protest) was introduced after the Bjelke-Petersen era where for decades the National party government had made a habit of using the excuse of traffic disruption to suppress peaceful protest, any form of protest that was politically damaging for the National party.\"<\/p><p>The council's lawyer, Kevin Cartledge, told the court the protest would affect \"give or take 100\" bus services and could cause traffic delays lasting until about 10.30am.<\/p><p>\"Council does not oppose the holding of this or any other assembly,\" Cartledge said. \"It's a common law right and it's enshrined in the act. Council's position is not to oppose on the basis of any political issues... it is entirely based on the impacts the assembly will have on the public.\"<\/p><p>Sri told the court that council's claims about the traffic disruptions were \"overstated and could be mitigated\" and that the march would be on the roadway for about 1km.<\/p><p>Sri also argued that the \"impacts to traffic should not in-and of-themselves be considered significant justification to suppress a peaceful protest\".<\/p><p>He said that when Queensland passed the peaceful assembly act, it was noted during debate that it would allow demonstrations that would cause peak-hour traffic disruption in the CBD.<\/p><p>\"The act intended to make a very, very high threshold so that power could not be misused and abused,\" Sri told the court.<\/p><p>Under the act, a lawful assembly can be held by providing written notice to the police and the relevant local authority, in this case the Brisbane City Council.<\/p><p>Either can seek an order from a magistrate prohibiting an assembly. They must first hold a mediation session. The council had attempted in mediation to have protesters take a different route, or for the protest to start at 9.30am, after peak hour.<\/p><p>This week, Schrinner told News Corp he wanted the state government to amend the law, <url normalizedValue=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/australia-news\/2019\/aug\/20\/queensland-police-to-get-new-powers-to-search-climate-change-protesters\">allowing the city authority to outright refuse protests<\/url> without having to undertake mediation.<\/p><p>Outside the court, Sri said he was happy with the decision.<\/p><p>\"It is not up to governments to decide what people get to protest about, or where we get to do it\" he said.<\/p><\/body>","13":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">About 100 students and community members marched from campus to Downtown Berkeley protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline on Sunday, in conclusion of an environmental justice conference held on campus over the weekend.<\/p><p>The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has previously alleged that the pipeline's approval violates the National Historic Preservation Act and puts the tribe's livelihood, sacred sites and water at risk.

This means that you, the reader, need to learn to differentiate between an independent, well-researched point of view, and an embedded public relations plug-whether it is on television, in your favourite newspaper or on social media. Here is a primer culled from the FT report.<\/p><p>Brand Journalism: A new form of reporting is one that's produced by companies and tailored to project a company's point of view. Companies hire professional journalists to produce these polished reports, so that the ordinary reader is unable to see them as PR plugs.<\/p><p>FT cites the example of oil major Chevron, which runs a hyper-local digital news brand at Richmond, California (where it is headquartered). While it publishes mainly feel-good news, it also helps gloss over allegations about environmental damage. In India, Reliance Industries has hired a team of senior journalists to 'manage' its social media image, publish videos and books, to project its point of view.<\/p><p>Churnalism: This is the process where PR agencies create slickly produced content that is released directly to people through social media, YouTube, etc, as news. Interestingly, loss-making mainstream media is often happy to 'embed' these videos and photographs in their reports, making it a win-win for corporate PR.<\/p><p>The report cites the examples of Apple's iPhone6 launch (fully choreographed with live blogging, perfectly lit images and gushing endorsements from celebrities being re-tweeted) and Microsoft introducing Indian-born CEO Satya Nadella to the media in a similar manner. The head of General Motors recorded an emotive YouTube video of her reaction to faulty ignition leading to fatal crashes prior to appearing before the US Congress hearing.<\/p><p>Native Advertising a.k.a Paid News: Advertisements made to look like a genuine news story or video where the reader cannot know the difference. This is called native advertising and is rampant in India, too, having been pioneered by our biggest media house.<\/p><p>Owned Media: The whole gamut of direct corporate communication through social media, twitter, blogs or direct-speak by celebrity business corporate honchos, such as Richard Branson, who have millions of followers on social media. These CEOs don't need mainstream media to get their message out anymore. Prime minister Narendra Modi used this brilliantly to craft a thumping election victory.<\/p><p>Interestingly, while the Editors Guild of India has written to the PM to provide more meaningful access to the media, FT says this is a global phenomenon. It says, \" from White House to Wall Street, journalists protest that they are getting less meaningful access to those in power than ever.\" <\/p><\/body>","911":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Javelin Strategy &amp; Research's (<url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.javelinstrategy.com\">www.javelinstrategy.com<\/url> ) latest report investigates consumer personal finance behaviors toward social media, including two groundbreaking case studies of three trail-blazing financial institutions (FIs) that are taking the customer service conversation to the consumer on Twitter. While most Americans are resistant to mixing social media and personal finances, a new trend is emerging: one in ten consumers are comfortable using social media sites to review or check account balances. Javelin presents key recommendations on how FIs can develop effective strategies to engage consumers through social media, while addressing privacy and security concerns.<\/p><p>Throughout the weeks of vocal protest spanning Bank of America's announcement and retraction of $5 debit card fees, Bank Transfer Day, and Occupy Wall Street protests, Twitter volume jumped threefold at the customer service \"handles\" at these three banks: Citi, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo. Citi appeared to be doing the best job of providing direct answers to consumers' questions via Twitter and was able to resolve 36% of its customer service conversations within Twitter. Confusion ensued as consumers were unsure which handles to access and too often received no response at all.<\/p><p>\"As FIs begin to participate in social media channels they need to be prepared to allocate sufficient resources to address and resolve consumer issues,\" said Mark Schwanhausser, Senior Analyst, Multichannel Financial Services. \"Other FIs can take a cue from trailblazers like Citi, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo and start with the basics of branding and educating consumers through Twitter and other social media platforms.\"<\/p><p>\"Social media is the next frontier for the FI and consumer relationship,\" said James Van Dyke, President, Javelin. \"FIs that seek to capitalize on social media should target the most open-minded customers first: Core Millennials (college-age consumers), Moneyhawks (active users of online banking, FI bill pay and mobile banking), Asians, Latinos, and African Americans. We've created a set of step-by-step recommendations that will help FIs interact effectively with consumers through social media, including how to balance responsiveness and regulatory compliance, how to handle private customer service conversations in public places, and many other decisions.\"<\/p><p>Javelin's Banking and Social Media: Easy to Say, Hard to Do report is based on an evaluation of 5,489 Twitter customer service responses from FIs over the seven-week period from September 20 to November 10, 2011, an examination of 300 full Twitter conversations between FIs and consumers on November 28, 2011 (aka Cyber Monday), and survey data collected online from more than 5,102 consumers.<\/p><p>5th Annual Mobile Security Report: Mitigating Security Risks Transforms the Mobile Banking Channel How To Attract and Keep High-Value 'Moneyhawks': Increase Profitability Through Targeted Multichannel Service Messaging Social Media and Banking: Brand Opportunity, Risk or Complete Waste of Time?<\/p><\/body>","498":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\"\/><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Sep 10, 2014 (Digital Journal:<url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.digitaljournal.com\">http:\/\/www.digitaljournal.com<\/url> Delivered by Newstex)<br\/> More than 60 prominent websites and upwards of a million people will participate in today's Internet Slowdown Day to protest the FCC's rules change what would \"slow down\" the Internet.<br\/> The protest was sparked by the January 14, 2014 U.S. Federal Court ruling, Verizon v Federal Communication Commission's (FCC). In that ruling, U.S.<person><nameText>Circuit Judge David Tatel <\/nameText><\/person>says[1]:<\/p><p><br\/><br\/>\"Given that the Commission has chosen to classify broadband providers in a manner that exempts them from treatment as common carriers, the Communications Act expressly prohibits the Commission from nonetheless regulating them as such. Because the Commission has failed to establish that the anti-discrimination and anti-blocking rules do not impose per se common carrier obligations, we vacate those portions of the Open Internet Order.\"<br\/> The Open Internet Order Tatel speaks about refers to the December 2010 order [2] in which the FCC defines open internet as:<br\/> \"A level playing field where consumers can make their own choices about what applications and services to use, and where consumers are free to decide what content they want to access, create, or share with others.\"<br\/> It further states that the order would ensure:<br\/> 1. Transparency: That all ISPs must transparently disclose to their subscribers and users all relevant information as to the policies that govern their network<br\/> 2. No Blocking: That no legal content may be blocked<br\/> 3. No Unreasonable Discrimination: That ISPs may not act in a commercially unreasonable manner to harm the Internet, including favoring the traffic from an affiliated entity.<br\/> Although the principles behind the order, that Internet service providers (ISP) should treat all Internet traffic the same, should not block or slow down traffic or modify services based on the traffic to and from sites, seems fair and reasonable, many major ISP's immediately began challenging the order. The Verizon challenge and subsequent ruling virtually eliminated those principles. <br\/> In light of the ruling, the FCC proposed a rules change in May of this year. The changes would essentially clear the way for ISP's to offer so called \"fast lanes\" to higher paying customers. For example, Verizon, Comast or another ISP could force Netflix, Meetup, Etsy or any online company to pay a premium to have their services in the \"fast lane\" and ensure customers receive quality, uninterrupted content. Although many may not have much sympathy to major conglomerates such at Netflix, the idea of paying for \"fast lanes\" could put an undo burden on smaller competitors, thus potentially eliminating the idea of a fair marketplace. <br\/> The idea of unequal treatment for content providers and customers is seen as a threat to the idea of net neutrality, the idea that no portion of Internet information should be prioritized over another.<br\/> Reddit co-founder, Alexis Ohanian, calls[3] the Internet \"the most democratic vehicle for free expression the world has ever known.\" He argues that the Internet is a free market that allows both small and large businesses and equal playing field and allows the average person the opportunity to create \"tomorrow's Google or next year's Facebook.\"<br\/> The idea that the principles of net neutrality and an open Internet are in jeopardy spawned Internet Slowdown Day. The protest is organized by Fight for the Future[4], which believes the proposed rule change[5] would create a two-tiered Internet. Fight for the Future told CNET[6] the two-tiered system would mean \"slow lanes (for most of us) and fast lanes (for wealthy corporations that are willing to pay fees in exchange for fast service).\" This would \"discriminate against online content and applications.\"<br\/> Battle for the Net[7] has also joined in the cause, saying:<br\/> \"Cable companies would have the power to discriminate against online content and applications \u2014 they could pick winners and losers, shake sites down for fees, block content for political reasons, and make it easier for Internet users to view cable content. (For instance, Comcast owns NBC, and so has incentives to make it easier to view NBC content than that of other providers.)\"<br\/> Top websites such as Netflix, Meetup, Reddit, Foursquare, Vimeo and Wordpress are also taking up the cause and participating in \"Slowdown Day.\" As a way of showing their support, they will post various graphics on their sites as a sign of solidarity and support for an open Internet. <br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>Tumblr plans on releasing a video about net neutrality, as well as urge users to use a net neutrality hashtag in social media posts and e-mail lawmakers in Congress. Tumblr also issued a statement saying:<br\/> \"A multi-tiered system, catered purely to the economic interests of broadband providers with termination monopolies to end consumers, will undoubtedly harm innovation and competition in industries reliant on the Internet (a set of industries that now extends far beyond the usual 'tech' sector) and stifle free expression for millions of users of Tumblr.\"<br\/> Individuals are asked to show their support by changing their Twitter or other social media profile photos to a spinning loading icon. It is estimated that a million or more people will participate in the protest in one way or another. <br\/><br\/><br\/>According to a Washington Post report[8], the FCC has received 1.1 million people comments regarding the rules change, with only approximately one percent of the comments showing support for the change. <br\/> The protest may already be seeing results before it can really begin. Engine, a Silicon Valley lobby group, told the Guardian[9]:<br\/> 'With over one million public comments already filed with the FCC, much has been written about why the FCC's proposed rules would damage the internet, but the FCC needs to see firsthand how Internet fast lanes would devastate startups.' <br\/> Those comments have caused FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler to backtrack from the proposed rules change, saying[10] the FCC will not allow creation of Internet of \"haves\" and \"have-nots\". <br\/> Although the protest will not actually \"slow down\" the Internet, organizers believes it sends a strong message to not only FCC, but to IPS's such as Comcast and Verizon. With Wheeler seemingly succumbing to mounting pressure from the public, it remains to be seen what if any impact \"Slowdown Day\" will have on the major ISP's. With growing public outcry against the a push to eliminate the idea of an equal and neutral Internet, one can only hope the fear of customer outrage will encourage them to embrace the principle of an open Internet. <br\/><br\/>Play Video[11]<br\/> [1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.cadc.uscourts.gov\/internet\/opinions.nsf\/3AF8B4D938CDEEA685257C6000532062\/%24file\/11-1355-1474943.pdf\">http:\/\/www.cadc.uscourts.gov\/internet\/opinions.nsf\/3AF8B4D938CDEEA685257C6000532062\/%24file\/11-1355-1474943.pdf<\/url> [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.fcc.gov\/guides\/open-internet\">http:\/\/www.fcc.gov\/guides\/open-internet<\/url> [3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2014\/9\/8\/6122675\/right-now-the-internet-needs-your-help-to-survive\">http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2014\/9\/8\/6122675\/right-now-the-internet-needs-your-help-to-survive<\/url> [4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https:\/\/www.fightforthefuture.org\">https:\/\/www.fightforthefuture.org<\/url>\/ [5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https:\/\/apps.fcc.gov\/edocs_public\/attachmatch\/DOC-327104A1.pdf\">https:\/\/apps.fcc.gov\/edocs_public\/attachmatch\/DOC-327104A1.pdf<\/url> [6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/top-websites-join-internet-slowdown-day-in-symbolic-protest-of-fast-lanes\/\">http:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/top-websites-join-internet-slowdown-day-in-symbolic-protest-of-fast-lanes\/<\/url> [7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https:\/\/www.battleforthenet.com\">https:\/\/www.battleforthenet.com<\/url>\/ [8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/the-switch\/wp\/2014\/09\/02\/sunlight-99-percent-of-net-neutrality-comments-wanted-stronger-fcc-rules\/\">http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/the-switch\/wp\/2014\/09\/02\/sunlight-99-percent-of-net-neutrality-comments-wanted-stronger-fcc-rules\/<\/url> [9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2014\/sep\/04\/etsy-mozilla-reddit-protest-net-neutrality\">http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2014\/sep\/04\/etsy-mozilla-reddit-protest-net-neutrality<\/url> [10]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/top-websites-join-internet-slowdown-day-in-symbolic-protest-of-fast-lanes\/\">http:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/top-websites-join-internet-slowdown-day-in-symbolic-protest-of-fast-lanes\/<\/url> [11]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/fpbOEoRrHyU?wmode=transparent\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/fpbOEoRrHyU?wmode=transparent<\/url><\/p><p\/><\/body>","934":"Alphabet Inc.: to organize a protest march against the companyLGBTQ Content Creators Sue YouTube for Discrimination","914":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>Rupert Murdoch <\/nameText><\/person>is back to <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/news\/rupert-murdoch-rips-hollywood-leftists-766451?utm_source=LexisNexus&amp;utm_campaign=Syndication&amp;utm_medium=Rupert+Murdoch+Weighs+In+on+U.K.+Tabloid+Topless+Women+Controversy\">trolling<\/url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/news\/rupert-murdoch-rips-hollywood-leftists-766451?utm_source=LexisNexus&amp;utm_campaign=Syndication&amp;utm_medium=Rupert+Murdoch+Weighs+In+on+U.K.+Tabloid+Topless+Women+Controversy\">the<\/url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/news\/rupert-murdoch-rips-hollywood-leftists-766451?utm_source=LexisNexus&amp;utm_campaign=Syndication&amp;utm_medium=Rupert+Murdoch+Weighs+In+on+U.K.+Tabloid+Topless+Women+Controversy\">Internet <\/url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/news\/rupert-murdoch-rips-hollywood-leftists-766451?utm_source=LexisNexus&amp;utm_campaign=Syndication&amp;utm_medium=Rupert+Murdoch+Weighs+In+on+U.K.+Tabloid+Topless+Women+Controversy\">via<\/url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/news\/rupert-murdoch-rips-hollywood-leftists-766451?utm_source=LexisNexus&amp;utm_campaign=Syndication&amp;utm_medium=Rupert+Murdoch+Weighs+In+on+U.K.+Tabloid+Topless+Women+Controversy\">Twitter<\/url>.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">The News Corp CEO and chairman weighed in on the controversy surrounding topless models that feature on Page 3 of the company's top U.K. tabloid The Sun.

Today, we are pleased to have with us Roberta Jacobson, the Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs. On June 26th through the 29th, she traveled to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. She met with leaders with from all sectors of Central American society to advance our regional partnership for a more secure and prosperous Central America. She will discuss the accomplishments of this trip and review the goals of the Western Hemisphere agenda, and it will then be opened for questions and answers. Thank you.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: All right. Thank you, Jean, and good afternoon. Its nice to see everybody again. I am relatively recently back from Central America, and I wanted to start off talking a little bit about that, about the trip, and about some of the things I saw and put it in a little bit of context, and then we can open it up to whatever everyone would like to talk about.<\/p><p>So let me start off saying that it had been about a year and a half since I had been to Central America, and so it seemed like a good idea to get back there. Obviously, this is a big focus for us, especially in our security programs, and the Central American Regional Security Program is obviously an integral part of all four of our interlocking security citizen security initiatives: the Merida Initiative in Mexico, Central American Regional Security Initiative, the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, and the Colombia Strategic Development Initiative. So it was important for me to get back to talking with some of our Central American partners.<\/p><p>I think overall one of the things that you see in Central America, which is a hallmark of what were doing around the hemisphere, really is the two areas in particular, one, that the engagement on security issues goes well beyond law enforcement and just the police or military side of security. When we talk about working with partners in the hemisphere on citizen security issues, were talking about an integrated approach to citizen security that spans the gamut, and Im going to talk about that again in a minute.<\/p><p>But the other thing I wanted to mention was it was very important to me that I highlight something that the Secretary has talked about a great deal, Secretary Clinton, which is the importance of civil society. One of the things the Secretary has said she said it at the Summit of the Americas in talking with the civil society forum, but she has repeated it since is that for us our foreign policy really does have three legs in this stool. And those legs are government and we obviously undertake a lot of government-to-government interaction the private sector and the business community, and civil society writ large. And I felt that I had had a pretty good opportunity over the last year or so to interact with governmental counterparts, and obviously I was going to do some of that on this trip, but that it was most important for me to make sure that I touch base with civil society activists because that is the sense that you cant really get in Washington. That is the value added of traveling. So that was an emphasis of the trip.<\/p><p>Since 2008, I think most of you know, the Central American Regional Security Initiative we have appropriated and disbursed close to $500 million of assistance in Central America, with the considerable amount of our focus on the three northern triangle countries: El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, which were the three that I visited. Those span the range of this integrated approach, as I mentioned, which really does run from police and security, law enforcement activity, to prosecutors, judges, public defenders, working with judicial systems, alternative dispute resolution, and onto efforts that were making in communities to strengthen communities to withstand the impact of transnational crime. And thats why over 90 percent of our assistance, bilateral assistance in Central America, is focused on core development issues health, education, issues like support for civil society and economic growth.<\/p><p>So I traveled to the three countries in that order, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. And two of the things that I think were most exciting for me were events that I was able to hold focusing on education and youth. In El Salvador, I was privileged to hand out 49 micro scholarships as part of our SEMILLA or SEED program. This has been in effect for many years, but weve amplified it more recently. The recipients were 50 percent female and all students that came from rural areas, students who might otherwise never have had an opportunity to go to the United States and study. And what was just as exciting as meeting the students who are going to study education, healthcare, small business development what was just as exciting was meeting their families, people who had traveled pretty long distances to be there for this celebration of their childrens success, and I thought that was terrific. We also had the privilege of having one of the alumni of the program with us who is a two-term mayor in La Union, of a community in La Union, and former governor, who was a participant in this SEED program when he was in high school. They will be studying at community colleges across the United States.<\/p><p>In Guatemala, I had the opportunity to go to Coban and to visit with students in our Access English program. What some folks may not know is that the Access English program in Guatemala is the largest in the hemisphere with 1,400 students, over 700 alumni, which is a little bit surprising, I think, to many people. But these kids were just remarkable. They are incredible students of English. They were very proud of what they had done. A number of the advanced students were serving as translators and interpreters for a U.S.-Guatemalan military humanitarian exercise that was underway called Beyond the Horizon, which I also visited. And they are serving with the medics, translating not from Spanish to English but from Kiche to English. And so they were just performing these invaluable services as a result of being able to take these classes in English for a number of months. And they were just remarkable and very enthusiastic about their work. So those were two of the things that I did.<\/p><p>In Guatemala, El Salvador, and in Honduras I also met with groups of civil society, human rights, nongovernmental organizations, those working in labor, working on legal reforms. And the group that I met with that was the largest was in El Salvador, but in Guatemala and Honduras I also got a very good representation of civil society. In Honduras, that included meeting with leaders of the Alliance for Peace and Justice, which is about a three-month-old civil society consortium, which I was very impressed with, impressed with their work and impressed with their enthusiasm, including Julieta Castellanos, the rector of the University in Honduras whose son was tragically killed last year.<\/p><p>In all three places, I think one of the things that left me optimistic was the fact that there were such vibrant civil society organizations engaged, doing their own work, working in communities, gathering their own statistics, challenging the government on occasion, but also working with them to try and create safer communities.<\/p><p>The other thing that impressed me was we know from statistics that communities in which we work with municipal governments, especially USAIDs programs on prevention and on economic opportunity, those communities have seen marked decreases in crime. But one of the things that impressed me the most in El Salvador was so have communities in which we are not necessarily working, but community leaders themselves are working to organize some of those same efforts. And so it really underscored the belief that you cannot fight crime without the engagement and involvement of the community and without creating some opportunities, especially for young people.<\/p><p>The other things, I had meetings in all three countries, obviously, with government leaders. In Honduras, there was a SICA meeting that was taking place, and that was the reason part of the reason that I was there. It was very exciting for me to be there for the first time as a formal observer to SICA, since the U.S. and I signed those papers a couple of months ago. The SICA meeting, as you may know, had a little bit of turbulence in one of the agreements that was being signed within SICA with Panama, but it really went very well in the end. We were able to make the statement about the importance of regional efforts and that no country can do this alone. Our programs are premised on regional cooperation to combat transnational crime.<\/p><p>But the other thing I thought was very exciting was that the SICA countries were able to sign the agreement with the EU, which was there to do so, which reinforces, I think, those of us who were members of the Friends of Central America group, remaining engaged and working together to coordinate our assistance in that part of the world.<\/p><p>So I left Central America, I think, frankly, slightly more optimistic than Ive been in a while. I think this is a very long, hard slog that is going to take quite a while, because fundamentally, the efforts against transnational crime can only be combated by stronger democratic institutions, institutions like the police and military, institutions like the judiciary, institutions like the fiscales (ph), institutions in communities. And so that is a long-term project and not one that were going to see turn around immediately. But I think people are starting to know what works and starting to replicate it, and I also think weve seen very important movement forward over the last year or two by governments to create the structures and the legal frameworks, the policy agenda that makes success possible, which is certainly a very important first step. There is still a ways to go.<\/p><p>But I also came back very encouraged by what were doing with young people. The best part of my job and I said this while I was there the best part of my job is the engagement with young people on educational issues, because that it sounds like sort of kumbaya and clich, but that actually is the way we ensure that things get better in the future. So I was very encouraged by that.<\/p><p>And I will leave you finally with a reiteration of the importance of institutions. I was listening to Fernando Henrique Cardoso over the last two days and last night when he won the Kluge Prize at the Library of Congress, which is a $1 million prize for his academic study of humanity. And he talked about a phrase that we have seen elsewhere, but I really like it in this context, which is the infrastructure of hope. And in the end, the infrastructure of hope, what it means is democratic institutions that can withstand corruption, that can withstand transnational crime, that can withstand abuse, and thats what were trying to construct with our partners in Central America. So let me stop there and open things up.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. So first question, well go right here. Just wait for the microphone and state your name and<\/p><p>QUESTION: Jesus Esquivel from Proceso Magazine. Roberta, I have two questions for you one on Central America and the other on Mexico. The President-elect of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, has said hes going to change the strategy in the war on drugs, especially with the relation of the United States. He wants to demilitarize the strategy, and second, he says hes going to concentrate more on the issue of security for the Mexican people. And he says the measure of success is not on the number of confiscation of drugs and the arrest of the capos in Mexico.<\/p><p>My question to in this regard is: Is the U.S. Government worried about it? You know very well the issue of narcotics in Mexico, and that will probably increase the number of drugs crossing the border if hes going to do exactly what hes saying. Are you guys worried about it? I know youre going to say, We are ready to work with him, but the State Department already said that.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Youre answering your own question, Jesus. (Laughter.)<\/p><p>QUESTION: Well, but Roberta, we need more<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Its a fair question.<\/p><p>QUESTION: We need more specific answer to that. And the second is on Central America. He also said that one of his priorities will be working with Central America and trying to include Brazil on that. And he says the Merida Initiative is not working as it was planned on Central America. So he says he want to have more hemisphere approach to the problem of the security and international crime in Central America. Whats your position on that?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Okay. Thanks. I appreciate that, and let me start with the first question. Im not going to surprise you. Im not worried. And part of the reason Im not worried is because I think weve certainly watched and listened to everything that Enrique Pena Nieto has said before the election and now since the election, and youre right, Im going to say that we look forward to working with him, which we do.<\/p><p>But its also true that I have seen nothing in anything he has said that gives me cause for concern. The notion that somebody wants to re-look at a strategy and possibly make changes I think is not only to be expected but a healthy thing. Strategies get put into place to respond to a moment in time and hopefully move you forward, right, in the fight against transnational organized crime. But they also have to be adaptable. They have to shift and change, because we know that the criminal organizations shift and change.<\/p><p>We also know, and I would say much more broadly, that the notion that you want to go from whats your measure of success is it drugs interdicted, is it rates of homicide or violence I have always said, and I think we have said from the beginning with the Merida Initiative, that there are many multiple metrics that you can use and that clearly the level of violence in Mexico is unacceptable to Mexicans and it should be unacceptable to all of us. And so the fact that that is an important metric for the President-elect, I think is entirely logical. I dont think it necessarily means there will be less drugs interdicted. I dont know exactly what changes to the strategy the new President may make and what those changes what effect those changes will have on the cartels. I think well have to wait and see. But its a very productive conversation to have. And it is clearly one of the things you hear from all over the region, is that the level of violence is too high, that that has to go down. Its why we have seen changes in the way that people approach this problem. Its why you see changes like the truce that was brokered in El Salvador with the gangs. There is a real desire to lower that level of violence that is entirely understandable.<\/p><p>But I would also say that when you talk about Central America and where Mexico may shift or emphasize engagement with Central America, I think thats incredibly encouraging. I think thats exactly the right message, which is that we all have to be working better together, that Mexico has an enormous amount to contribute even while it is confronting these problems at home, but that there are others in the hemisphere who have something that they can bring to the table to support efforts in Central America. Weve seen that already, quite frankly, very actively and very positively with Colombia, in Central America, and with Chile, already engaging with those countries on ways of doing business and ways of combating corruption and criminal activity that have been successful and can be modeled or replicated or adjusted for Central America.<\/p><p>The notion of whether Brazil can also play a role on that, I think is a very positive conversation to have. I think certainly the Brazilians have capabilities and have experience that can be useful, and we think the more partners from within the hemisphere that can help in Central America, the better.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. For our next question, well go in the front here to Sonia.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi. Thank you. My name is Sonia Schott. I am with Globovision, Venezuela. Heavyweight Republicans have criticized the politics towards the political strategy towards Venezuela. I was wondering if you have any comments on that, if you agreed on that, because it seems to be that the bilateral relations are in a freeze point. It is because the electoral year, not only here but in Venezuela, and that makes me go to my second question. You have repeatedly asked for a transparent process, electoral process in Venezuela. What did that mean? What will need to happen in Venezuela in order for you to recognize it was a transparent electoral process? Does it has to do with the electoral missions? Thank you.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thank you. I appreciate that. I think it probably will not surprise you that I disagree with the notion that we do not have a good policy on Venezuela. I think the thing about our policy on Venezuela is and I would argue that, yes, we are both in electoral years; yes, electoral years in every country in the world make international relations more complicated because domestic politics takes precedence in many ways. But I would argue to you that the relationship that we have with Venezuela, if indeed its frozen and I dont disagree that it is not as productive as it could be right now but that that started before certainly before our electoral calendar really picked up, and it was independent of that. And frankly, it is disappointing to us because we are willing to and happy to engage on practical issues where we can cooperate or we may see things the same way. But we have not had that reciprocated from the Venezuelan Government, and thats unfortunate.<\/p><p>We also obviously would like to be able to cooperate on issues of regional importance, but that has not been possible because the Venezuelan Government has not seemed eager to do that, to work with us, as opposed to speaking, in the rhetorical sense certainly, against some of the United States initiatives and some of our efforts. So that is disappointing to us. And we remain ready to have that more productive relationship, but not willing to do anything more than extend that hand. And if it is not reciprocated, then we arent willing to take that any further. Its just not productive.<\/p><p>Let me also say, though, that on the elections, I think there are very clear ways in which Venezuela can ensure that the international community at large not just the United States, which frankly is not necessarily the arbiter here, it is the international community at large can have confidence in the results. And the way to do that is to welcome in observers. And so we hope that that will be the case, that Venezuela will welcome in observers, whether from the EU or the OAS. I think that would make a very large difference in the confidence that those in the international community have in the results.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. For our next question, well go to New York.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Yes. Hello. I am Ana Baron from Clarin of Argentina. Thank you very much for this press conference. I have two questions on Argentina. First of all, while we know that trade restrictions was one of the subjects you discussed on your last trip to Argentina, so I wanted to know since then there was the United States complaint in the WTO. Now Argentina, some time ago some minutes ago, hours ago has presented a complaint against the lemons and meat restrictions in U.S. market. So I wanted to know if we are assisting to a little trade war between the two countries.<\/p><p>And second, I have a question of narco-trafficking. You were talking a lot about narco-trafficking in Central America. Since the plane the military plane was detained in Ezeiza, it seems that the cooperation between the two countries has diminished significantly. I wanted to know if this is a subject that worries and if you see some prospective of ameliorating the relationship at this on this subject.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thank you. I think on the first point, on the trade issues, it certainly wasnt the central part central component of my visit there. Im not a trade expert for the U.S. Government. But I certainly did have conversations, and we continue, obviously, as you note, in these movements more recently to continue to have conversations with Argentina about concerns that we have, whether on specific trade issues or on import restrictions and other things that U.S. companies are finding difficult in Argentina. We continue again to look for a way that we can cooperate on these issues, but we do think that there are international rules and regulations that we all have to abide by. And its one of the reasons why the WTO is there, why organizations like ICSID or SIAVE (ph)*, the organization to arbitrate financial disputes. What we believe in is a rules-based system in which folks actually comply with the rules, which we will do when the decisions go against us and we hope other countries will do when decisions go against them.<\/p><p>So were still trying to work through all of these issues, but I will say that there is a desire on both parties sides, I think certainly speaking for the United States Government to try and resolve those issues in as productive a way as we can, and to try and recognize that we have lots of other components of a bilateral relationship that can move ahead. And we want to be sure that while we work on those economic, commercial, or trade problems that we may have in the relationship, they do not, frankly, bleed into other areas of the relationship where we have a more positive engagement and we are able to move forward.<\/p><p>When I was in Argentina in February, two of the things that I worked on and that I think that Im particularly excited about are moving forward on educational exchanges, which, frankly, are pretty low between Argentina and the United States. I think theres head room there, room to grow.<\/p><p>And so weve moved forward with an agreement with the Argentine Government on some additional scholarships and pushing up those numbers. And I had a meeting with 13 rectors of universities that was very productive, as well as with the Minister of Education. But we also signed a sister parks agreement for our national parks, which I think is also very important, and was very impressed by the Argentine presentation on that.<\/p><p>In following up on that, we now have we had the NASA administrator who went to Argentina. And we have Tecnopolis, I think opening this week perhaps in Argentina, with an exhibit from the United States. So theres lots of other areas in which we can cooperate.<\/p><p>Getting to your second question because I think it relates, obviously cooperating on narcotics is one of those areas where I think that we should still be able to work together regardless of other problems. And its also true that cooperation on security issues, in particular narcotics\/counternarcotics efforts, was clearly set back by the incident last year. I am pretty optimistic that were going to be able to move ahead on a cooperative agenda on narcotics issues. I think there is a desire on the part of the Argentine Government to move ahead on that, and I certainly will confirm that there is a strong desire on our part.<\/p><p>So Im more optimistic probably even than I was when I was in Argentina four or five months ago that we can move ahead on that productively.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Great. For our next question well go in the front right here.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Jacobson. This is Tomas Guevara, the editor of El Diario de Hoy, Salvador. When you visited recently El Salvador, the countrys in a serious political crisis now. What do you think about that situation between the conflict with the national assembly, with the supreme court, and how it can impact the relationship with the U.S.?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I think its an incredibly important question, and I was struck obviously by that dispute between the assembly and the court when I was in El Salvador. And I obviously spoke with a lot of people about it to learn as much as I could, to hear from folks on the ground what they saw as the prospects for resolution. And this was I was there just before July 1. Now weve passed that July 1 date, and so in some respects the issue has gotten even more acute.<\/p><p>And I would say this does concern us very greatly. This is clearly something that Salvadorans have to resolve, that we have said clearly, both I have said it in El Salvador but our Ambassador and we were all thrilled to have Mari Carmen Aponte back in San Salvador as our Ambassador has said publicly that we really do urge in the strongest terms possible that the two sides of this dispute really try and come together and resolve it. And I think thats important. It is a Salvadoran dispute to resolve; it is not ours to opine on how it gets resolved. We would just like to see it resolved.<\/p><p>But I will say that there are some issues that are important to us that engage the court or the national assembly, and those things are being, frankly, held up by this dispute. The question of extraditions, which there are a number of extraditions pending, and we think its important that extraditions be part of not the only available tool but part of the tool kit that governments be able to use to fight transnational crime. Those may not move ahead while this dispute simmers.<\/p><p>There is discussion in El Salvador, I certainly heard from all sides, of new investment laws and things that need to move ahead in the national assembly, which would be very important and very, I think, beneficial for the Partnership for Growth effort that were undertaking with El Salvador and the efforts that were trying to make to move ahead on economic development. If those things get slowed down by this dispute, then thats a problem that really affects more than just El Salvador, unfortunately.<\/p><p>QUESTION: A follow-up?<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Sure. A follow-up.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi. This is Luis Alonso. Are you concerned with the stability of the President Funes Government? Because of this dispute, is there a state of rule of law in danger by this dispute?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I confess to you, I have seen lots of breathless commentary about this. And theres no doubt in my mind that this is a serious concern and a serious problem that needs to be worked out, but I have absolutely no concerns about the stability of the Funes Government and its sort of democracy surviving in El Salvador. This is a dispute between two branches of government. I have every confidence that Salvadorans from the various branches of government will resolve this is an amicable and legal and constitutional way, and that overall the democratic health of El Salvador will not suffer for it.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. The next question well go here and then to Denise after.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Santiago Tavara from Notimex. Do you have any update on the in Honduras the recent incidents, two incidents that involved DEA agents? And about the first incident, I think Spokesperson Victoria Nuland told us that she would release a report in the next weeks. I dont know if you have a date. And also, the second question is on Peru regarding human rights abuses reported against people who are protesting against gold mine<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Conga.<\/p><p>QUESTION: -- a proposed mine in Peru from the U.S.-based Newmont Mining Corporation. I dont know if you have any reaction.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Well, let me start on Honduras. Obviously, weve been in engaged with in support of the Honduran Government in operations against narcotics trafficking in northern Honduras, coastal Honduras, in the last number of months. In those operations, over two and a half tons of cocaine was seized in two-plus just over two months, which is an extraordinary record. I want to say clearly from the outset that in the first incident and Im not sure which first or second were talking about, but May 11th, in which it would appear from the reports that weve seen certainly from the preliminary reports that four people were killed. And that is never what you want to happen, and we regret that greatly. That was an incident in which it was not the DEA but Hondurans who were firing guns and fired upon.<\/p><p>But in all of these incidents, I think we have to wait until the investigations and the reviews are concluded. What we will do as things proceed is we will obviously be reviewing with our Honduran counterparts exactly what the operations how they worked, what worked well, what didnt work well, how can we avoid, obviously, any deaths in the future.<\/p><p>And I will also say that in the second two incidents, which were ones in which DEA did unfortunately the DEA agents did unfortunately kill those who were trafficking drugs, we do expect, frankly, that those actually doing the trafficking will resist losing their cargo and being arrested. And unfortunately, it is a very dangerous game. What we want to try and ensure with our Honduran partners is that nobody who is not involved in narco-trafficking is wounded or killed as a consequence of these operations.<\/p><p>But I think that it does reinforce the importance of that area physically, geographically, in terms of the root of cocaine up north towards the United States. And we have seen lots of indications polls taken in Honduras of support for our continued engagement, and the government has made clear that they would like the United States to remain engaged in that support and training role.<\/p><p>The second question was on Peru and reports of human rights abuses to those protesting. Its the Conga Mine, I assume. And to be honest with you, Ive seen some of the press reports, but I dont have any independent information on that. Obviously, its always worrisome when you have a situation in which there is violence, in which protest is not carried out peacefully. And what we would like to see and obviously in support of the Peruvian Government, its not a role for us is a resolution to the very difficult situation that has emerged between the community and the mining company. And I think the Peruvian Government is trying to resolve that as best they can.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Im Denise Chrispim Marim from O Estado de Sao Paolo, Brazil. Thank you very much for this opportunity. We were waiting for a long time for this.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Im sorry. (Laughter.)<\/p><p>QUESTION: Well, I wonder (inaudible) and I wanted to ask you what is exactly the position of United States in the case of the crisis in Paraguay, particularly if you how is your assessment on the sanctions that has already been imposed against Paraguay by regional organizations? And how could be the best approach of OAS in this case?<\/p><p>Secondly, if you dont mind<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: That was all the first? Wasnt that like three parts?<\/p><p>QUESTION: No, it is you know that there is a lot of talks and speculations on a meeting between military American militarys and Paraguayan officials in Asuncion last days. And there is some speculations on the interest of America to build a military base in Paraguay. I wonder to know if you are aware about this information and if it is really a desire of United States.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Okay, let me start out with that second part, because I want to be very, very clear about this. I have no information about U.S. military meeting with Paraguayan counterparts or officials in recent days. So Im not sure what thats referring to.<\/p><p>We have no desire no desire, let me be clear about this to do anything in Paraguay that isnt either requested by the Paraguayan Government or an event, an occasion, a training, an engagement that is a partnership with Paraguay. And we have no interest in promoting a base or military presence in Paraguay separate or apart from sort of our normal interaction with the Paraguayans on counternarcotics issues, on training issues, on counterterrorism. We have engaged in that kind of cooperation very transparently for years, and we hope to continue to do that. That is very different than this notion of building bases, which I really want to dispel, because it does keep coming up, which I find somewhat bizarre.<\/p><p>The other thing I want to be clear about is that we are not only transparent about what our interests and our opportunities or engagement is with the Paraguayans to the public, to our own officials, to the Congress, but to anybody else in the region whos interested. And obviously weve had conversations with our Brazilian counterparts on what each of us are doing cooperatively with Paraguay, and so that there will never be surprises in that area.<\/p><p>On the crisis in Paraguay, I think one of the things that I think is important is the report of the OAS was presented to the Permanent Council yesterday, I guess, and we were obviously very pleased to be part of that mission. The mission was made up of the U.S., Mexican, Canadian, Haitian, and Honduran ambassadors to the OAS plus the Secretary General and I think one or two of his staff. I think that that mission really got a huge spectrum of opinions while they were there all of the branches of government, President Lugo and members of his cabinet, and so meeting with President Franco and folks from his cabinet and other organizations. So I think that was a very, very important step for the OAS to take because I do think that there were conversations that needed to take place about why things happened the way they did and what justification there was for things that hadnt really taken place. So I think that that was a very important first step, and we strongly support the Secretary General in that mission. That was certainly clear by our sending our ambassador. And we continue to support his efforts and think the report is really quite well done.<\/p><p>As we look forward because I think that what we really want to do is focus on the future and what assistance Paraguay may ask for and need from the OAS in terms of preparations for elections, dialogue on issues that are still of concern and creating tension, moving ahead to ensure that in this transition period, Paraguay gets ready for exemplary elections in April of 2013. And I think in that respect, we have an enormous amount in common with all of our regional partners who I think also want to look ahead and cooperate in helping Paraguay get to that point.<\/p><p>In terms of what sub-regional organizations may have done, sanctions or suspensions, I think thats for them to comment on. Weve been very comfortable with where the OAS is on this, and we think its an excellent forum for continued engagement.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Follow-up? (Laughter.)<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Well go to the follow-up and then to your question or is it a follow-up as well?<\/p><p>QUESTION: No, its a follow-up, but about another issue. So we can follow up this one.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. (Laughter.) So you pick.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Rock, paper, scissor.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi. Yes. Youve said that the report by the Secretary General of the OAS was quite well done. I wanted to know what your assessment is, what your opinion is, on his concrete proposals to send a mission to Paraguay until the elections, and also if you think that, as he said, that its not a constructive step to suspend Paraguay from the organization.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Name your media organization?<\/p><p>QUESTION: Its EFE.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I will give you the short answer to that as yes on both questions. The only thing I would add is I think the report is very well done. I think the notion of sending a mission, sending technical experts and that could change. It depends on what Paraguayans feel they need or what the skills are that is needed at the time. And as you get closer to election, different kinds of skills are needed. But I think the notion of having the OAS remain engaged with a mission in Paraguay is a very good one, a very positive one that I think would be helpful I believe and I hope for Paraguay and for all of the rest of us trying to sort of grapple with the issue. And I think that hes right, that at this point there really doesnt appear to be a reason to suspend Paraguay from the OAS.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: So now to your follow-up question.<\/p><p>QUESTION: So thank you for doing this. I am Silvia Pisani from La Nacion in Argentina. Also, so first, I would like to ask you a very specific follow-up in the first question about Argentina, and then I will jump into another line. But the follow up is: Also, I saw some concern in the United States about a specific point of the currency exchange policy in Argentina, regarding the possibility of buying dollars. And this was affecting the American enterprises to their imports because they cant buy the dollars that they need to import.<\/p><p>And also, its beginning to now, its beginning to generate some fear in the population of the possibility of traveling abroad. So I would like to ask you if you still have those concerns and if you specifically raised them to the Argentinean Government, and if that is the case, if you received any answer about that. Thats the first point.<\/p><p>And jumping in another line, I would like to ask you: I have been seeing in the Congress particularly some concern about the freedom of expression and the freedom of press in Argentina. I would like to ask your opinion about that. Thank you.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Okay. Thank you. What I can tell you in terms of the currency issue or the ability of, in particular, U.S. businesses to operate and be able to get currency out of the country, for example, which is one of the things I heard a great deal about when I was in Argentina in February, one of the difficulties that some of our companies are having is that for many of them, it may not be that difficult because theyre not they dont operate with huge amounts of cash. For certain sectors and I think you can probably figure out which ones; it may be airlines, it may be others but for certain sectors who get a lot of revenue in cash, if you will, they have difficulties. And some of these restrictions were making things difficult for them. And so what we had asked at the time was that the Government of Argentina look at the impact of some of these restrictions, which are very broad, on particular sectors which maybe have more acute difficulty with them. And so thats a continuing discussion that were having with the Argentine Government.<\/p><p>On freedom of expression, I guess I should say: We have talked a lot about this over the last year or so. Weve talked about our concerns for journalists in the hemisphere all of you, every day, know this for your brothers and sisters working in countries throughout the hemisphere, we see with a great deal of, I think the word is just sadness and anguish, when international organizations put out statements about this region being the most dangerous for journalists. I mean, that is really sometimes shocking to us. And that danger, obviously, has come from different quarters. And its come ferociously from organized crime, frankly. But there have been other threats to journalists work not to their lives, let me be clear, but to their work and to the freedom of expression that has been mounted by governments. Whether its lawsuits, whether it is withdrawal of revenue or advertisement, whether it is shutting things down, there are threats that confront journalists. And that it seems to us really critically important as part of democracy in the hemisphere. A free press is not optional. Its an integral part of democracy in the hemisphere.<\/p><p>Now, I think you would probably agree that in Argentina we certainly could not say that there is not an opposing view in the press to that of the government. There is certainly a healthy, open, exchange in the press. But I do think its important that we continue to press to ensure that governments understand that you really dont want to start down the slippery slope of trying to reduce the amount of freedom and ability to get their message out, the news out, the information out, because it can be a slippery slope, and thats very, very frightening for all of us.<\/p><p>I should say that I think there are lots of new ways of getting information, and so when people talk about press freedom and media ownership in the hemisphere as being too concentrated or its only one view of the situation in a particular country, it seems to us that the answer to that is essentially further democratization of media and press, which becomes easier in our digital and social media age, not a narrowing of that voice.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. Well go to Jose and then in the front here.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. Thank you for doing this really. Jose Diaz-Briseno with Reforma from Mexico. When talking about the understandable, well, a concern in Mexico to lower the violence, specifically the homicide rate, you mentioned the truce of murders in El Salvador. Do you think thats a model that could be feasible and desirable in Mexico between the cartels?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I think that every case is different. And I think that truces have to be seen and this is what I have certainly heard from experts on this subject, and I am not one of them. I will preface with that. But I have certainly heard from experts on this that the one thing you have to be sure of is that truces ceasefires, as theyre often called in the United States; ceasefire Chicago, Boston has tried some of these theyre never a permanent answer, right? So they are at best, even where they work and they dont always work they are at best a temporary measure while you put into place more structural and institutional changes to reduce either violence or drug trafficking or homicide or whatever or gang activity.<\/p><p>And so I think one of the things that we need to be a little bit careful of is the notion that a truce is what we all continue to look for, sort of the magic bullet, the single thing you can do that will solve this problem. And I think some of this the structure of organized crime and narcotics trafficking I think is significantly different than gang activity. And so I think both the multiplicity of players and the trade that theyre in make it much more complicated and much less likely that is a productive tool in that particular setting. But I think thats something that obviously people look at all the time, both academics and practitioners.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi, again. Just to going back to Paraguay, just want to make sure that the assessment on whether or not the impeachment of President Lugo is a coup detat has been finished. Have you guys reached a conclusion, like the OAS expressed yesterday, or youre still assessing the --<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Well, I think what I would say is that the OAS and what the Secretary General set out in his report makes a lot of sense to us. The Secretary General talked about concerns over the rapidity or the speed of the process. We have expressed those concerns publicly. But he also talked about the constitution in Paraguay and what it provides for. And so he is striking that balance between a process that may have seemed too rapid but also is set out in their constitution. And so I think the most important thing we support his report, and the most important thing at this point is to look for constructive ways moving forward to engage with the Paraguayans, including with the Franco government, to get to the elections next year.<\/p><p>QUESTION: So it was not a coup detat?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Im not going to answer that question, Luis.<\/p><p>QUESTION: (Inaudible.)<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thats the implication of what I said, that may be.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. Silvia Ayuso from the German Press Agency. My question is related to Cuba. There are increasing reports, rumors, nothing yet still confirmed about a possible outbreak of cholera even that might have reached even Havana. I was wondering if you have some information, and would that be the case? Would that affect some kind of I mean, the travels to the island what could be done in this respect from the U.S.?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Let me just say that its my understanding actually that Cuba has made a statement that there is cholera but that its under control in eastern part of Cuba. And so at this point, frankly, what we know is what weve seen as the press, as all of you have. I will say that obviously if there has been an outbreak of cholera, whether its under control or not, these this is the kind of information that we often put into I dont know that we will, but we often put into our Consular Information Sheets or Travel Warnings where they exist to make sure that Americans know about that possibility. But I dont know that thats been done yet or will need to be done. Well have to see how this develops.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Next question here, and then to you.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you very much. Im Lina Correa from Voice of America, also in Cuba. A few weeks ago the State Department asked for a humanitarian act in the case of Alan Gross. Have you received any answer from the Cuban Government about that? And also, how can the public opinion in United States value that U.S. policy with regard to Cuba when we cannot see any sign of change there?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Well, I think on the first question, on Alan Gross, youre quite right. We have actually repeatedly made a request of the Cuban Government to release Alan Gross on a humanitarian basis to be home with his family, to see his 90-year-old mother whos dying of cancer, and to attend to his own health issues. And no, we have not gotten an acceptable response at this point. And obviously he is not home with his family, so that has not occurred. Despite the fact that Mr. Gonzalez was permitted by the court to see his brother, who was ill, we have not gotten that kind of action from the Cuban Government on Mr. Grosss case.<\/p><p>On the issue of change in Cuba, I think one of the things that is always hard to judge is it is difficult for us sometimes to understand, where there may be change, how much change there may be. We obviously cant venture very far outside Havana very often, and that makes it difficult for us to know what may be happening in other parts of the country. There are a lot of economic changes that have been announced, that have been talked about, that have been rumored, but not as much thats actually been implemented and thats being seen, I think, on the ground and in peoples lives.<\/p><p>But I think its interesting, when you see Raul Castro going to VietnamVietnam, which is a country which has made significant changes and with which we obviously want to see even further changes on the political side, but economic changes have already been made there is no doubt, it seems to me, that there is continued discussion and studying and interest in changes in Cuba.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, we have not seen any conversation from the governments side of political changes. Lots of conversation about economic changes that may or may not make a huge difference in peoples lives, but no changes in the ability of people to express themselves freely, to organize into political parties, et cetera. And that I mean, that does not change our policy, nor do I think it denigrates it any way. But what it does mean, I think, is that continuing the people-to-people contact that we have had, the changes that this President made to the regulations both on travel and on remittances with Cuba, are important ones to try and engage with the Cuban people in the absence of our ability to engage and see change in the Cuban Government.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: We have time for one or two more questions. Well start here.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thanks. Martha Avila from RCN TV, Colombia. Whats your opinion about the security in Colombia today? In the last days, the FARC has increased the terrorist attacks in the country. How see the U.S. Government the situation? The security in Colombia is worse?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I dont think that thats a conclusion that I would draw yet at this point, and I certainly hope its one that I wont be drawing. We certainly have seen those attacks and we are concerned about them, and we obviously deplore the violence. I want to actually make just a side comment because I failed to mention it when Jose and I were talking. I want to also reject the violence against El Norte in Monterrey, against a newspaper there.<\/p><p>But in the case of the FARC in Colombia, I think that its very clear that that is not the way forward, that the government will handle these issues and handle them well. We have confidence in the Government of Colombia. But I dont think that anyone can yet draw a conclusion that security is worse in Colombia. And I certainly hope that will not be the case and that the FARC will not return to acts of violence such as they committed in the past, which obviously we deplored and continue to. And thats not the way ahead in Colombia.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi. Im Luciana Coelho, Folha de Sao Paulo, Brazil. Just to bring back to the OAS a little bit, there are some concern from a group of NGOs and even within the OAS that there are a group of countries organized to kind of, Id say, deflate the system and the OAS and its importance. And Brazil is in its group, and also Ecuador and others. So the situation in Paraguay and the divisions within the member countries since supposed risk of exacerbation of this movement. Id like to know if the U.S. is paying any attention to that, if there is any concern, and if you see that this could harm the inter-American system.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thank you for the question. I actually I think many of you may have seen some of the comments that I made, that our delegation made, and some of the things that were said at the OAS General Assembly in Cochabamba. In particular, the OAS the inter-American system on human rights came under just fierce attack, I mean just the fiercest Ive ever seen. And that is something that worries us enormously.<\/p><p>The heart in some respects, the heart of the Organization of American States and the thing that, in my opinion, it should be most proud of is the inter-American system on human rights the commission, the court, all of the processes that have been developed over the years. You may take issue with individual decisions. The United States is brought before the commission more than any other country in the hemisphere, and we very often dont agree with the decisions. But we will defend the commission and its right to act forever, because the system is not designed for a particular case. It is not designed for a particular government. Its designed to protect the constellation of rights and democratic freedoms that we have all agreed to against any kind of incursion. And sometimes those decisions are difficult for countries. But the discomfort is the price we pay for a system that defends all of us at various times and has defended very important issues of human rights in the last 40 years in this hemisphere.<\/p><p>So I think that the OAS General Assembly was of I mean, the conversations that we held there, I think, were of great concern to us. And moving forward, we want to find ways to strengthen and yes, reform, in part the inter-American human rights system, but not to destroy it.<\/p><p>And I will say I just want to be clear about this that unfortunately, it became clear at the General Assembly that some peoples goals wasnt reform. In fact, they didnt even use the words reform. They used the words destruction. And that to me it wasnt me interpreting those words; it was what was said. So having that out on the table, maybe now we can talk about how to reform the system and in fact continue to strengthen it, even when we dont like its decisions all the time, as will happen.<\/p><p>I do think that moving ahead on the issue of Paraguay, we have an opportunity here in the hemisphere. We have an opportunity to work together on an issue that concerns all of us, which is strengthening democracy and strengthening dialogue in Paraguay. I think the way the OAS has gone about this has been very healthy and very productive, but I think there are important roles for countries in South America. And we will continue to work, for example, with Brazil on this issue very closely. We will continue to be in contact with our colleagues in Chile, in Colombia, in Peru. All of those countries are important to moving this ahead and finding a constructive outcome, which I think everybody wants. We have had good conversations with our Uruguayan counterparts.<\/p><p>So I dont I see Paraguay in some ways as a way for us to come together as a region to support Paraguayan democracy, not as an issue which will exacerbate divisions.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Could you expand your comment regarding the attacks against El Norte, if possible?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Right. I mean, the only thing I want to say about that is we have seen, obviously, violence against journalists, individual journalists, but also against newspapers or other media outlets in Mexico in the past. These attacks just unfortunately sort of continue or take that to another level, and they have to be rejected by everyone. And one of the things that worries me the most in Mexico is the threat of physical violence, which causes both, obviously, an inability to report stories just because of physical harm but also leads to self-censorship, if were not careful, because of fear, a climate of fear.<\/p><p>And so I think that we all have to stand up and speak out against that kind of violence and hope to work with the government, because I think the current government has made it very clear that they dont accept those kinds of attacks and that they want to work on resolving those cases and reducing the incidents of violence against journalists and media outlets, and that well do everything we can to help in that area.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Im afraid were out of time. I want to thank Assistant Secretary Jacobson for coming here. I hope you return soon.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thank you very much.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you.<\/p><\/body>","1389":"Strike Against GM OverNorth Texas Workers Join Nationwide Strike Against GM Over Contract Dispute","709":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Zimbabwe police have detained US citizen Martha O'Donovan for allegedly referring to President Robert Mugabe as a \"goblin\" on Twitter.

When customers heard of this move, they were immediately upset. They anger was stirred even further when Bank of America CEO <person><nameText>Brian Moynihan <\/nameText><\/person>said, \u201cWe have a right to make a profit,\u201d at a Washington get-together, where he tried to explain why they were making this move.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\"> Tweeters and Facebook-users quickly ignited a fiery protest, which focused around comments such as, \u201cWe have a right to bank elsewhere.\u201d Emboldened by the comments of others, the online demonstration grew quickly to encompass many different blogs, media sites and even online signature protests.<\/p><p> It didn\u2019t take long before the digital torches opened the eyes of Moynihan and other Bank of America execs, who decided that a quick exit from their strategy was the only logical course of action. Bank of America withdrew plans for monthly charges for debit card users.<\/p><p> But enraged Bank of America customers had already taken their ire a step further. Propelled by a Facebook event page protest, more than 84,000 people signed up to join the mass exodus from the corporate banking world by moving their money out of banks and into credit unions. Saturday, Nov. 5, was promoted by protestors as \u201cBank Transfer Day.\u201d<\/p><p> The Credit Union National Association estimated in the week following the Sept. 29 debit card fee announcement by Bank of America, more than 650,000 Americans have joined credit unions.<\/p><p> The Bank of America debit card charge debacle is a perfect example of the power the Internet gives to the average person. The Internet and social media intensify public reaction. They give people more power than they have ever had before.<\/p><p> People don\u2019t actually have to boycott a product or service.They can simply talk about doing so, and if their complaints gain enough traction on the Internet, they will get the wanted reaction. Combined voices intensify grievances, and no company wants to stand against such speedy, persuasive and energetic protests.<\/p><p> Although Facebook and Twitter are currently the two most popular social media outlets, you don\u2019t have to have a Facebook or Twitter account to make your voice heard. Blogs are also a great place to voice your opinion. And you don\u2019t have to have your own blog either. You can post your comments on the blogs of others.<\/p><p> Last year, I made some accurate but disparaging remarks about one of the major telephone companies on my blog. Others posted similar comments on my blog in response. Within several days, a company representative came on the blog to say the company wanted to rectify the situation. The representative also sent me a personal email with a follow-up.<\/p><p> You can post your message or complaint on my blog at <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.sandybergerblog.com\">www.sandybergerblog.com<\/url> or any blog and get results. You don\u2019t even have to be totally on topic.<\/p><p> For instance, if you want to complain about a company that I haven\u2019t written about, you can add your comment to any blog post that I have written. I read every comment. So if you suggest that I write about a subject or company and it fits my subject matter, I\u2019ll be happy to write a new blog post on that topic where you and others can comment.<\/p><p> You might ask how I can be sure that the company you are trying to reach will see your comments. Well, that\u2019s easy. You see, every major company today uses clipping services that scour the Web and alert them when their company name is mentioned.<\/p><p> Many have crews of individuals who do nothing but sort through those comments and respond to them. Although the services that these companies use are generally pretty sophisticated, you can get a feel for how they work by trying a free service called Google Alerts at <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/alerts\">www.google.com\/alerts<\/url>.

However, for the students, one of the key achievements was the hashtag Hokkolorob, which went viral on social networking sites ever since it was launched last September. It further picked up pace this week after the CM's announcement on the VCs resignation, which was their main demand, and the withdrawal of the indefinite hunger strike by a few students.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Avishek De Biswas, a theatre actor and ex-student of the university, can be dubbed as the accidental author of the hashtag. He was initially trying to support his friend, the woman student of JU who was molested and harassed on campus in August last year. The controversy resulted in the standoff between students and university authorities and culminated in an indefinite hunger strike by a group of students since early this year and an embarrassment for the university authorities when a large section of them boycotted the formal convocation ceremony.<\/p><p>Spreading the Web<\/p><p>\"Even though I have finished my Masters in comparative literature from the university in 2013, I'm in touch with many of my juniors and professors. In fact, the girl who faced harassment by some seniors called me soon after the incident for help. I was among those who tried to help her get an FIR registered,\" says De Biswas. \"The protests built up around the lack of support for the student and no action against the guilty by the university authorities and later the beating up of students by the police during a peaceful demonstration,\" he adds. After the initial apathy shown by the college authorities, he casually said \"Hokkolorob\" - let there be noise - to a group of friends, borrowing the phrase from the name of a Bengali music album by Shayan Chowdhury (Arnob) released in 2006.<\/p><p>Scoring a First<\/p><p>\"The phrase caught the imagination of all of us on campus immediately. Initially, it was being used as a hashtag on Facebook by many students. But within a couple of days, after the police lathicharge, students from many other campuses around the world started following the developments and using the hashtag on Twitter and Facebook,\" says Anisha Mandal, an undergrad of JU in the comparative literature department. She adds that the way it went viral was beyond expectations and a first for a student movement in India.<\/p><p>Hokkolorob, a community page on Facebook, currently has 56,713 likes, with hundreds of posts added in the past week.According to hashtag tracking tool Keyhole, Hokkolorob had a reach of 342,130 users this week. Among the prominent people using the hashtag on various social networking sites are Bengali actor Swastika Mukherjee and Union minister of state for urban development Babul Supriyo.<\/p><p>Ex-students of the JU too responded to Hokkolorob. \"The first time when I heard about this a few months back, I searched for the hashtag on Facebook to understand what was going on. Thereafter I used to monitor it to stay updated,\" says Amitavha Mukherjee, a New Jersey-based ex-student in mechanical engineering from the class of 1998 and now vice-president, Citigroup Inc. Mukherjee is part of the executive committee of the local alumni chapter, Jadavpur University East Coast Alumni Association ( JUECA). \"The incidents in the campus did naturally draw my attention, and thereafter I connected with a few folks who are in the campus. I also participated in a few conference calls and arranged some local folk in a Skype video-conference. And yes, I did use the hashtag in Facebook, myself,\" he adds.<\/p><p>The Global Connect<\/p><p>Like him, New York-based entrepreneur Shib Shankar Dasgupta updated himself about the movement through the hashtag posts on Facebook and Twitter. \"We organised a meeting of JU alumni based in the US East Coast at NYC's Central Park in support of the students. The hashtag helped us to stay updated and to share our thoughts. We are very happy that the demand for the VC's resignation has been met,\" Dasgupta told ET Magazine.<\/p><p>Aritra Chakraborti, a PhD student of the English department, who is currently a visiting researcher at King's College, London, too feels that the hashtag Hokkolorob helped the students take the spirit of their protest to the academic community around the world. \"When the protest started, I was in Belgium. The use of the hashtag helped me share the developments with my colleagues across universities in Europe. Even though I was not physically present on campus, I felt myself a part of what was happening at JU and could offer my support through posts on social media. While this has happened in other countries such as Hong Kong and Egypt during mass student movements, in India it was probably the first time,\" he said.<\/p><p>For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com<\/p><\/body>","727":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Exactly one year ago, Roman Cochet swapped his $500 iPhone 7 for a $30 LG flip phone.

Today, we are pleased to have with us Roberta Jacobson, the Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs. On June 26th through the 29th, she traveled to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. She met with leaders with from all sectors of Central American society to advance our regional partnership for a more secure and prosperous Central America. She will discuss the accomplishments of this trip and review the goals of the Western Hemisphere agenda, and it will then be opened for questions and answers. Thank you.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: All right. Thank you, Jean, and good afternoon. Its nice to see everybody again. I am relatively recently back from Central America, and I wanted to start off talking a little bit about that, about the trip, and about some of the things I saw and put it in a little bit of context, and then we can open it up to whatever everyone would like to talk about.<\/p><p>So let me start off saying that it had been about a year and a half since I had been to Central America, and so it seemed like a good idea to get back there. Obviously, this is a big focus for us, especially in our security programs, and the Central American Regional Security Program is obviously an integral part of all four of our interlocking security citizen security initiatives: the Merida Initiative in Mexico, Central American Regional Security Initiative, the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, and the Colombia Strategic Development Initiative. So it was important for me to get back to talking with some of our Central American partners.<\/p><p>I think overall one of the things that you see in Central America, which is a hallmark of what were doing around the hemisphere, really is the two areas in particular, one, that the engagement on security issues goes well beyond law enforcement and just the police or military side of security. When we talk about working with partners in the hemisphere on citizen security issues, were talking about an integrated approach to citizen security that spans the gamut, and Im going to talk about that again in a minute.<\/p><p>But the other thing I wanted to mention was it was very important to me that I highlight something that the Secretary has talked about a great deal, Secretary Clinton, which is the importance of civil society. One of the things the Secretary has said she said it at the Summit of the Americas in talking with the civil society forum, but she has repeated it since is that for us our foreign policy really does have three legs in this stool. And those legs are government and we obviously undertake a lot of government-to-government interaction the private sector and the business community, and civil society writ large. And I felt that I had had a pretty good opportunity over the last year or so to interact with governmental counterparts, and obviously I was going to do some of that on this trip, but that it was most important for me to make sure that I touch base with civil society activists because that is the sense that you cant really get in Washington. That is the value added of traveling. So that was an emphasis of the trip.<\/p><p>Since 2008, I think most of you know, the Central American Regional Security Initiative we have appropriated and disbursed close to $500 million of assistance in Central America, with the considerable amount of our focus on the three northern triangle countries: El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, which were the three that I visited. Those span the range of this integrated approach, as I mentioned, which really does run from police and security, law enforcement activity, to prosecutors, judges, public defenders, working with judicial systems, alternative dispute resolution, and onto efforts that were making in communities to strengthen communities to withstand the impact of transnational crime. And thats why over 90 percent of our assistance, bilateral assistance in Central America, is focused on core development issues health, education, issues like support for civil society and economic growth.<\/p><p>So I traveled to the three countries in that order, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. And two of the things that I think were most exciting for me were events that I was able to hold focusing on education and youth. In El Salvador, I was privileged to hand out 49 micro scholarships as part of our SEMILLA or SEED program. This has been in effect for many years, but weve amplified it more recently. The recipients were 50 percent female and all students that came from rural areas, students who might otherwise never have had an opportunity to go to the United States and study. And what was just as exciting as meeting the students who are going to study education, healthcare, small business development what was just as exciting was meeting their families, people who had traveled pretty long distances to be there for this celebration of their childrens success, and I thought that was terrific. We also had the privilege of having one of the alumni of the program with us who is a two-term mayor in La Union, of a community in La Union, and former governor, who was a participant in this SEED program when he was in high school. They will be studying at community colleges across the United States.<\/p><p>In Guatemala, I had the opportunity to go to Coban and to visit with students in our Access English program. What some folks may not know is that the Access English program in Guatemala is the largest in the hemisphere with 1,400 students, over 700 alumni, which is a little bit surprising, I think, to many people. But these kids were just remarkable. They are incredible students of English. They were very proud of what they had done. A number of the advanced students were serving as translators and interpreters for a U.S.-Guatemalan military humanitarian exercise that was underway called Beyond the Horizon, which I also visited. And they are serving with the medics, translating not from Spanish to English but from Kiche to English. And so they were just performing these invaluable services as a result of being able to take these classes in English for a number of months. And they were just remarkable and very enthusiastic about their work. So those were two of the things that I did.<\/p><p>In Guatemala, El Salvador, and in Honduras I also met with groups of civil society, human rights, nongovernmental organizations, those working in labor, working on legal reforms. And the group that I met with that was the largest was in El Salvador, but in Guatemala and Honduras I also got a very good representation of civil society. In Honduras, that included meeting with leaders of the Alliance for Peace and Justice, which is about a three-month-old civil society consortium, which I was very impressed with, impressed with their work and impressed with their enthusiasm, including Julieta Castellanos, the rector of the University in Honduras whose son was tragically killed last year.<\/p><p>In all three places, I think one of the things that left me optimistic was the fact that there were such vibrant civil society organizations engaged, doing their own work, working in communities, gathering their own statistics, challenging the government on occasion, but also working with them to try and create safer communities.<\/p><p>The other thing that impressed me was we know from statistics that communities in which we work with municipal governments, especially USAIDs programs on prevention and on economic opportunity, those communities have seen marked decreases in crime. But one of the things that impressed me the most in El Salvador was so have communities in which we are not necessarily working, but community leaders themselves are working to organize some of those same efforts. And so it really underscored the belief that you cannot fight crime without the engagement and involvement of the community and without creating some opportunities, especially for young people.<\/p><p>The other things, I had meetings in all three countries, obviously, with government leaders. In Honduras, there was a SICA meeting that was taking place, and that was the reason part of the reason that I was there. It was very exciting for me to be there for the first time as a formal observer to SICA, since the U.S. and I signed those papers a couple of months ago. The SICA meeting, as you may know, had a little bit of turbulence in one of the agreements that was being signed within SICA with Panama, but it really went very well in the end. We were able to make the statement about the importance of regional efforts and that no country can do this alone. Our programs are premised on regional cooperation to combat transnational crime.<\/p><p>But the other thing I thought was very exciting was that the SICA countries were able to sign the agreement with the EU, which was there to do so, which reinforces, I think, those of us who were members of the Friends of Central America group, remaining engaged and working together to coordinate our assistance in that part of the world.<\/p><p>So I left Central America, I think, frankly, slightly more optimistic than Ive been in a while. I think this is a very long, hard slog that is going to take quite a while, because fundamentally, the efforts against transnational crime can only be combated by stronger democratic institutions, institutions like the police and military, institutions like the judiciary, institutions like the fiscales (ph), institutions in communities. And so that is a long-term project and not one that were going to see turn around immediately. But I think people are starting to know what works and starting to replicate it, and I also think weve seen very important movement forward over the last year or two by governments to create the structures and the legal frameworks, the policy agenda that makes success possible, which is certainly a very important first step. There is still a ways to go.<\/p><p>But I also came back very encouraged by what were doing with young people. The best part of my job and I said this while I was there the best part of my job is the engagement with young people on educational issues, because that it sounds like sort of kumbaya and clich, but that actually is the way we ensure that things get better in the future. So I was very encouraged by that.<\/p><p>And I will leave you finally with a reiteration of the importance of institutions. I was listening to Fernando Henrique Cardoso over the last two days and last night when he won the Kluge Prize at the Library of Congress, which is a $1 million prize for his academic study of humanity. And he talked about a phrase that we have seen elsewhere, but I really like it in this context, which is the infrastructure of hope. And in the end, the infrastructure of hope, what it means is democratic institutions that can withstand corruption, that can withstand transnational crime, that can withstand abuse, and thats what were trying to construct with our partners in Central America. So let me stop there and open things up.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. So first question, well go right here. Just wait for the microphone and state your name and<\/p><p>QUESTION: Jesus Esquivel from Proceso Magazine. Roberta, I have two questions for you one on Central America and the other on Mexico. The President-elect of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, has said hes going to change the strategy in the war on drugs, especially with the relation of the United States. He wants to demilitarize the strategy, and second, he says hes going to concentrate more on the issue of security for the Mexican people. And he says the measure of success is not on the number of confiscation of drugs and the arrest of the capos in Mexico.<\/p><p>My question to in this regard is: Is the U.S. Government worried about it? You know very well the issue of narcotics in Mexico, and that will probably increase the number of drugs crossing the border if hes going to do exactly what hes saying. Are you guys worried about it? I know youre going to say, We are ready to work with him, but the State Department already said that.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Youre answering your own question, Jesus. (Laughter.)<\/p><p>QUESTION: Well, but Roberta, we need more<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Its a fair question.<\/p><p>QUESTION: We need more specific answer to that. And the second is on Central America. He also said that one of his priorities will be working with Central America and trying to include Brazil on that. And he says the Merida Initiative is not working as it was planned on Central America. So he says he want to have more hemisphere approach to the problem of the security and international crime in Central America. Whats your position on that?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Okay. Thanks. I appreciate that, and let me start with the first question. Im not going to surprise you. Im not worried. And part of the reason Im not worried is because I think weve certainly watched and listened to everything that Enrique Pena Nieto has said before the election and now since the election, and youre right, Im going to say that we look forward to working with him, which we do.<\/p><p>But its also true that I have seen nothing in anything he has said that gives me cause for concern. The notion that somebody wants to re-look at a strategy and possibly make changes I think is not only to be expected but a healthy thing. Strategies get put into place to respond to a moment in time and hopefully move you forward, right, in the fight against transnational organized crime. But they also have to be adaptable. They have to shift and change, because we know that the criminal organizations shift and change.<\/p><p>We also know, and I would say much more broadly, that the notion that you want to go from whats your measure of success is it drugs interdicted, is it rates of homicide or violence I have always said, and I think we have said from the beginning with the Merida Initiative, that there are many multiple metrics that you can use and that clearly the level of violence in Mexico is unacceptable to Mexicans and it should be unacceptable to all of us. And so the fact that that is an important metric for the President-elect, I think is entirely logical. I dont think it necessarily means there will be less drugs interdicted. I dont know exactly what changes to the strategy the new President may make and what those changes what effect those changes will have on the cartels. I think well have to wait and see. But its a very productive conversation to have. And it is clearly one of the things you hear from all over the region, is that the level of violence is too high, that that has to go down. Its why we have seen changes in the way that people approach this problem. Its why you see changes like the truce that was brokered in El Salvador with the gangs. There is a real desire to lower that level of violence that is entirely understandable.<\/p><p>But I would also say that when you talk about Central America and where Mexico may shift or emphasize engagement with Central America, I think thats incredibly encouraging. I think thats exactly the right message, which is that we all have to be working better together, that Mexico has an enormous amount to contribute even while it is confronting these problems at home, but that there are others in the hemisphere who have something that they can bring to the table to support efforts in Central America. Weve seen that already, quite frankly, very actively and very positively with Colombia, in Central America, and with Chile, already engaging with those countries on ways of doing business and ways of combating corruption and criminal activity that have been successful and can be modeled or replicated or adjusted for Central America.<\/p><p>The notion of whether Brazil can also play a role on that, I think is a very positive conversation to have. I think certainly the Brazilians have capabilities and have experience that can be useful, and we think the more partners from within the hemisphere that can help in Central America, the better.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. For our next question, well go in the front here to Sonia.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi. Thank you. My name is Sonia Schott. I am with Globovision, Venezuela. Heavyweight Republicans have criticized the politics towards the political strategy towards Venezuela. I was wondering if you have any comments on that, if you agreed on that, because it seems to be that the bilateral relations are in a freeze point. It is because the electoral year, not only here but in Venezuela, and that makes me go to my second question. You have repeatedly asked for a transparent process, electoral process in Venezuela. What did that mean? What will need to happen in Venezuela in order for you to recognize it was a transparent electoral process? Does it has to do with the electoral missions? Thank you.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thank you. I appreciate that. I think it probably will not surprise you that I disagree with the notion that we do not have a good policy on Venezuela. I think the thing about our policy on Venezuela is and I would argue that, yes, we are both in electoral years; yes, electoral years in every country in the world make international relations more complicated because domestic politics takes precedence in many ways. But I would argue to you that the relationship that we have with Venezuela, if indeed its frozen and I dont disagree that it is not as productive as it could be right now but that that started before certainly before our electoral calendar really picked up, and it was independent of that. And frankly, it is disappointing to us because we are willing to and happy to engage on practical issues where we can cooperate or we may see things the same way. But we have not had that reciprocated from the Venezuelan Government, and thats unfortunate.<\/p><p>We also obviously would like to be able to cooperate on issues of regional importance, but that has not been possible because the Venezuelan Government has not seemed eager to do that, to work with us, as opposed to speaking, in the rhetorical sense certainly, against some of the United States initiatives and some of our efforts. So that is disappointing to us. And we remain ready to have that more productive relationship, but not willing to do anything more than extend that hand. And if it is not reciprocated, then we arent willing to take that any further. Its just not productive.<\/p><p>Let me also say, though, that on the elections, I think there are very clear ways in which Venezuela can ensure that the international community at large not just the United States, which frankly is not necessarily the arbiter here, it is the international community at large can have confidence in the results. And the way to do that is to welcome in observers. And so we hope that that will be the case, that Venezuela will welcome in observers, whether from the EU or the OAS. I think that would make a very large difference in the confidence that those in the international community have in the results.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. For our next question, well go to New York.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Yes. Hello. I am Ana Baron from Clarin of Argentina. Thank you very much for this press conference. I have two questions on Argentina. First of all, while we know that trade restrictions was one of the subjects you discussed on your last trip to Argentina, so I wanted to know since then there was the United States complaint in the WTO. Now Argentina, some time ago some minutes ago, hours ago has presented a complaint against the lemons and meat restrictions in U.S. market. So I wanted to know if we are assisting to a little trade war between the two countries.<\/p><p>And second, I have a question of narco-trafficking. You were talking a lot about narco-trafficking in Central America. Since the plane the military plane was detained in Ezeiza, it seems that the cooperation between the two countries has diminished significantly. I wanted to know if this is a subject that worries and if you see some prospective of ameliorating the relationship at this on this subject.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thank you. I think on the first point, on the trade issues, it certainly wasnt the central part central component of my visit there. Im not a trade expert for the U.S. Government. But I certainly did have conversations, and we continue, obviously, as you note, in these movements more recently to continue to have conversations with Argentina about concerns that we have, whether on specific trade issues or on import restrictions and other things that U.S. companies are finding difficult in Argentina. We continue again to look for a way that we can cooperate on these issues, but we do think that there are international rules and regulations that we all have to abide by. And its one of the reasons why the WTO is there, why organizations like ICSID or SIAVE (ph)*, the organization to arbitrate financial disputes. What we believe in is a rules-based system in which folks actually comply with the rules, which we will do when the decisions go against us and we hope other countries will do when decisions go against them.<\/p><p>So were still trying to work through all of these issues, but I will say that there is a desire on both parties sides, I think certainly speaking for the United States Government to try and resolve those issues in as productive a way as we can, and to try and recognize that we have lots of other components of a bilateral relationship that can move ahead. And we want to be sure that while we work on those economic, commercial, or trade problems that we may have in the relationship, they do not, frankly, bleed into other areas of the relationship where we have a more positive engagement and we are able to move forward.<\/p><p>When I was in Argentina in February, two of the things that I worked on and that I think that Im particularly excited about are moving forward on educational exchanges, which, frankly, are pretty low between Argentina and the United States. I think theres head room there, room to grow.<\/p><p>And so weve moved forward with an agreement with the Argentine Government on some additional scholarships and pushing up those numbers. And I had a meeting with 13 rectors of universities that was very productive, as well as with the Minister of Education. But we also signed a sister parks agreement for our national parks, which I think is also very important, and was very impressed by the Argentine presentation on that.<\/p><p>In following up on that, we now have we had the NASA administrator who went to Argentina. And we have Tecnopolis, I think opening this week perhaps in Argentina, with an exhibit from the United States. So theres lots of other areas in which we can cooperate.<\/p><p>Getting to your second question because I think it relates, obviously cooperating on narcotics is one of those areas where I think that we should still be able to work together regardless of other problems. And its also true that cooperation on security issues, in particular narcotics\/counternarcotics efforts, was clearly set back by the incident last year. I am pretty optimistic that were going to be able to move ahead on a cooperative agenda on narcotics issues. I think there is a desire on the part of the Argentine Government to move ahead on that, and I certainly will confirm that there is a strong desire on our part.<\/p><p>So Im more optimistic probably even than I was when I was in Argentina four or five months ago that we can move ahead on that productively.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Great. For our next question well go in the front right here.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Jacobson. This is Tomas Guevara, the editor of El Diario de Hoy, Salvador. When you visited recently El Salvador, the countrys in a serious political crisis now. What do you think about that situation between the conflict with the national assembly, with the supreme court, and how it can impact the relationship with the U.S.?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I think its an incredibly important question, and I was struck obviously by that dispute between the assembly and the court when I was in El Salvador. And I obviously spoke with a lot of people about it to learn as much as I could, to hear from folks on the ground what they saw as the prospects for resolution. And this was I was there just before July 1. Now weve passed that July 1 date, and so in some respects the issue has gotten even more acute.<\/p><p>And I would say this does concern us very greatly. This is clearly something that Salvadorans have to resolve, that we have said clearly, both I have said it in El Salvador but our Ambassador and we were all thrilled to have Mari Carmen Aponte back in San Salvador as our Ambassador has said publicly that we really do urge in the strongest terms possible that the two sides of this dispute really try and come together and resolve it. And I think thats important. It is a Salvadoran dispute to resolve; it is not ours to opine on how it gets resolved. We would just like to see it resolved.<\/p><p>But I will say that there are some issues that are important to us that engage the court or the national assembly, and those things are being, frankly, held up by this dispute. The question of extraditions, which there are a number of extraditions pending, and we think its important that extraditions be part of not the only available tool but part of the tool kit that governments be able to use to fight transnational crime. Those may not move ahead while this dispute simmers.<\/p><p>There is discussion in El Salvador, I certainly heard from all sides, of new investment laws and things that need to move ahead in the national assembly, which would be very important and very, I think, beneficial for the Partnership for Growth effort that were undertaking with El Salvador and the efforts that were trying to make to move ahead on economic development. If those things get slowed down by this dispute, then thats a problem that really affects more than just El Salvador, unfortunately.<\/p><p>QUESTION: A follow-up?<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Sure. A follow-up.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi. This is Luis Alonso. Are you concerned with the stability of the President Funes Government? Because of this dispute, is there a state of rule of law in danger by this dispute?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I confess to you, I have seen lots of breathless commentary about this. And theres no doubt in my mind that this is a serious concern and a serious problem that needs to be worked out, but I have absolutely no concerns about the stability of the Funes Government and its sort of democracy surviving in El Salvador. This is a dispute between two branches of government. I have every confidence that Salvadorans from the various branches of government will resolve this is an amicable and legal and constitutional way, and that overall the democratic health of El Salvador will not suffer for it.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. The next question well go here and then to Denise after.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Santiago Tavara from Notimex. Do you have any update on the in Honduras the recent incidents, two incidents that involved DEA agents? And about the first incident, I think Spokesperson Victoria Nuland told us that she would release a report in the next weeks. I dont know if you have a date. And also, the second question is on Peru regarding human rights abuses reported against people who are protesting against gold mine<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Conga.<\/p><p>QUESTION: -- a proposed mine in Peru from the U.S.-based Newmont Mining Corporation. I dont know if you have any reaction.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Well, let me start on Honduras. Obviously, weve been in engaged with in support of the Honduran Government in operations against narcotics trafficking in northern Honduras, coastal Honduras, in the last number of months. In those operations, over two and a half tons of cocaine was seized in two-plus just over two months, which is an extraordinary record. I want to say clearly from the outset that in the first incident and Im not sure which first or second were talking about, but May 11th, in which it would appear from the reports that weve seen certainly from the preliminary reports that four people were killed. And that is never what you want to happen, and we regret that greatly. That was an incident in which it was not the DEA but Hondurans who were firing guns and fired upon.<\/p><p>But in all of these incidents, I think we have to wait until the investigations and the reviews are concluded. What we will do as things proceed is we will obviously be reviewing with our Honduran counterparts exactly what the operations how they worked, what worked well, what didnt work well, how can we avoid, obviously, any deaths in the future.<\/p><p>And I will also say that in the second two incidents, which were ones in which DEA did unfortunately the DEA agents did unfortunately kill those who were trafficking drugs, we do expect, frankly, that those actually doing the trafficking will resist losing their cargo and being arrested. And unfortunately, it is a very dangerous game. What we want to try and ensure with our Honduran partners is that nobody who is not involved in narco-trafficking is wounded or killed as a consequence of these operations.<\/p><p>But I think that it does reinforce the importance of that area physically, geographically, in terms of the root of cocaine up north towards the United States. And we have seen lots of indications polls taken in Honduras of support for our continued engagement, and the government has made clear that they would like the United States to remain engaged in that support and training role.<\/p><p>The second question was on Peru and reports of human rights abuses to those protesting. Its the Conga Mine, I assume. And to be honest with you, Ive seen some of the press reports, but I dont have any independent information on that. Obviously, its always worrisome when you have a situation in which there is violence, in which protest is not carried out peacefully. And what we would like to see and obviously in support of the Peruvian Government, its not a role for us is a resolution to the very difficult situation that has emerged between the community and the mining company. And I think the Peruvian Government is trying to resolve that as best they can.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Im Denise Chrispim Marim from O Estado de Sao Paolo, Brazil. Thank you very much for this opportunity. We were waiting for a long time for this.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Im sorry. (Laughter.)<\/p><p>QUESTION: Well, I wonder (inaudible) and I wanted to ask you what is exactly the position of United States in the case of the crisis in Paraguay, particularly if you how is your assessment on the sanctions that has already been imposed against Paraguay by regional organizations? And how could be the best approach of OAS in this case?<\/p><p>Secondly, if you dont mind<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: That was all the first? Wasnt that like three parts?<\/p><p>QUESTION: No, it is you know that there is a lot of talks and speculations on a meeting between military American militarys and Paraguayan officials in Asuncion last days. And there is some speculations on the interest of America to build a military base in Paraguay. I wonder to know if you are aware about this information and if it is really a desire of United States.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Okay, let me start out with that second part, because I want to be very, very clear about this. I have no information about U.S. military meeting with Paraguayan counterparts or officials in recent days. So Im not sure what thats referring to.<\/p><p>We have no desire no desire, let me be clear about this to do anything in Paraguay that isnt either requested by the Paraguayan Government or an event, an occasion, a training, an engagement that is a partnership with Paraguay. And we have no interest in promoting a base or military presence in Paraguay separate or apart from sort of our normal interaction with the Paraguayans on counternarcotics issues, on training issues, on counterterrorism. We have engaged in that kind of cooperation very transparently for years, and we hope to continue to do that. That is very different than this notion of building bases, which I really want to dispel, because it does keep coming up, which I find somewhat bizarre.<\/p><p>The other thing I want to be clear about is that we are not only transparent about what our interests and our opportunities or engagement is with the Paraguayans to the public, to our own officials, to the Congress, but to anybody else in the region whos interested. And obviously weve had conversations with our Brazilian counterparts on what each of us are doing cooperatively with Paraguay, and so that there will never be surprises in that area.<\/p><p>On the crisis in Paraguay, I think one of the things that I think is important is the report of the OAS was presented to the Permanent Council yesterday, I guess, and we were obviously very pleased to be part of that mission. The mission was made up of the U.S., Mexican, Canadian, Haitian, and Honduran ambassadors to the OAS plus the Secretary General and I think one or two of his staff. I think that that mission really got a huge spectrum of opinions while they were there all of the branches of government, President Lugo and members of his cabinet, and so meeting with President Franco and folks from his cabinet and other organizations. So I think that was a very, very important step for the OAS to take because I do think that there were conversations that needed to take place about why things happened the way they did and what justification there was for things that hadnt really taken place. So I think that that was a very important first step, and we strongly support the Secretary General in that mission. That was certainly clear by our sending our ambassador. And we continue to support his efforts and think the report is really quite well done.<\/p><p>As we look forward because I think that what we really want to do is focus on the future and what assistance Paraguay may ask for and need from the OAS in terms of preparations for elections, dialogue on issues that are still of concern and creating tension, moving ahead to ensure that in this transition period, Paraguay gets ready for exemplary elections in April of 2013. And I think in that respect, we have an enormous amount in common with all of our regional partners who I think also want to look ahead and cooperate in helping Paraguay get to that point.<\/p><p>In terms of what sub-regional organizations may have done, sanctions or suspensions, I think thats for them to comment on. Weve been very comfortable with where the OAS is on this, and we think its an excellent forum for continued engagement.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Follow-up? (Laughter.)<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Well go to the follow-up and then to your question or is it a follow-up as well?<\/p><p>QUESTION: No, its a follow-up, but about another issue. So we can follow up this one.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. (Laughter.) So you pick.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Rock, paper, scissor.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi. Yes. Youve said that the report by the Secretary General of the OAS was quite well done. I wanted to know what your assessment is, what your opinion is, on his concrete proposals to send a mission to Paraguay until the elections, and also if you think that, as he said, that its not a constructive step to suspend Paraguay from the organization.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Name your media organization?<\/p><p>QUESTION: Its EFE.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I will give you the short answer to that as yes on both questions. The only thing I would add is I think the report is very well done. I think the notion of sending a mission, sending technical experts and that could change. It depends on what Paraguayans feel they need or what the skills are that is needed at the time. And as you get closer to election, different kinds of skills are needed. But I think the notion of having the OAS remain engaged with a mission in Paraguay is a very good one, a very positive one that I think would be helpful I believe and I hope for Paraguay and for all of the rest of us trying to sort of grapple with the issue. And I think that hes right, that at this point there really doesnt appear to be a reason to suspend Paraguay from the OAS.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: So now to your follow-up question.<\/p><p>QUESTION: So thank you for doing this. I am Silvia Pisani from La Nacion in Argentina. Also, so first, I would like to ask you a very specific follow-up in the first question about Argentina, and then I will jump into another line. But the follow up is: Also, I saw some concern in the United States about a specific point of the currency exchange policy in Argentina, regarding the possibility of buying dollars. And this was affecting the American enterprises to their imports because they cant buy the dollars that they need to import.<\/p><p>And also, its beginning to now, its beginning to generate some fear in the population of the possibility of traveling abroad. So I would like to ask you if you still have those concerns and if you specifically raised them to the Argentinean Government, and if that is the case, if you received any answer about that. Thats the first point.<\/p><p>And jumping in another line, I would like to ask you: I have been seeing in the Congress particularly some concern about the freedom of expression and the freedom of press in Argentina. I would like to ask your opinion about that. Thank you.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Okay. Thank you. What I can tell you in terms of the currency issue or the ability of, in particular, U.S. businesses to operate and be able to get currency out of the country, for example, which is one of the things I heard a great deal about when I was in Argentina in February, one of the difficulties that some of our companies are having is that for many of them, it may not be that difficult because theyre not they dont operate with huge amounts of cash. For certain sectors and I think you can probably figure out which ones; it may be airlines, it may be others but for certain sectors who get a lot of revenue in cash, if you will, they have difficulties. And some of these restrictions were making things difficult for them. And so what we had asked at the time was that the Government of Argentina look at the impact of some of these restrictions, which are very broad, on particular sectors which maybe have more acute difficulty with them. And so thats a continuing discussion that were having with the Argentine Government.<\/p><p>On freedom of expression, I guess I should say: We have talked a lot about this over the last year or so. Weve talked about our concerns for journalists in the hemisphere all of you, every day, know this for your brothers and sisters working in countries throughout the hemisphere, we see with a great deal of, I think the word is just sadness and anguish, when international organizations put out statements about this region being the most dangerous for journalists. I mean, that is really sometimes shocking to us. And that danger, obviously, has come from different quarters. And its come ferociously from organized crime, frankly. But there have been other threats to journalists work not to their lives, let me be clear, but to their work and to the freedom of expression that has been mounted by governments. Whether its lawsuits, whether it is withdrawal of revenue or advertisement, whether it is shutting things down, there are threats that confront journalists. And that it seems to us really critically important as part of democracy in the hemisphere. A free press is not optional. Its an integral part of democracy in the hemisphere.<\/p><p>Now, I think you would probably agree that in Argentina we certainly could not say that there is not an opposing view in the press to that of the government. There is certainly a healthy, open, exchange in the press. But I do think its important that we continue to press to ensure that governments understand that you really dont want to start down the slippery slope of trying to reduce the amount of freedom and ability to get their message out, the news out, the information out, because it can be a slippery slope, and thats very, very frightening for all of us.<\/p><p>I should say that I think there are lots of new ways of getting information, and so when people talk about press freedom and media ownership in the hemisphere as being too concentrated or its only one view of the situation in a particular country, it seems to us that the answer to that is essentially further democratization of media and press, which becomes easier in our digital and social media age, not a narrowing of that voice.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. Well go to Jose and then in the front here.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. Thank you for doing this really. Jose Diaz-Briseno with Reforma from Mexico. When talking about the understandable, well, a concern in Mexico to lower the violence, specifically the homicide rate, you mentioned the truce of murders in El Salvador. Do you think thats a model that could be feasible and desirable in Mexico between the cartels?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I think that every case is different. And I think that truces have to be seen and this is what I have certainly heard from experts on this subject, and I am not one of them. I will preface with that. But I have certainly heard from experts on this that the one thing you have to be sure of is that truces ceasefires, as theyre often called in the United States; ceasefire Chicago, Boston has tried some of these theyre never a permanent answer, right? So they are at best, even where they work and they dont always work they are at best a temporary measure while you put into place more structural and institutional changes to reduce either violence or drug trafficking or homicide or whatever or gang activity.<\/p><p>And so I think one of the things that we need to be a little bit careful of is the notion that a truce is what we all continue to look for, sort of the magic bullet, the single thing you can do that will solve this problem. And I think some of this the structure of organized crime and narcotics trafficking I think is significantly different than gang activity. And so I think both the multiplicity of players and the trade that theyre in make it much more complicated and much less likely that is a productive tool in that particular setting. But I think thats something that obviously people look at all the time, both academics and practitioners.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi, again. Just to going back to Paraguay, just want to make sure that the assessment on whether or not the impeachment of President Lugo is a coup detat has been finished. Have you guys reached a conclusion, like the OAS expressed yesterday, or youre still assessing the --<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Well, I think what I would say is that the OAS and what the Secretary General set out in his report makes a lot of sense to us. The Secretary General talked about concerns over the rapidity or the speed of the process. We have expressed those concerns publicly. But he also talked about the constitution in Paraguay and what it provides for. And so he is striking that balance between a process that may have seemed too rapid but also is set out in their constitution. And so I think the most important thing we support his report, and the most important thing at this point is to look for constructive ways moving forward to engage with the Paraguayans, including with the Franco government, to get to the elections next year.<\/p><p>QUESTION: So it was not a coup detat?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Im not going to answer that question, Luis.<\/p><p>QUESTION: (Inaudible.)<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thats the implication of what I said, that may be.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. Silvia Ayuso from the German Press Agency. My question is related to Cuba. There are increasing reports, rumors, nothing yet still confirmed about a possible outbreak of cholera even that might have reached even Havana. I was wondering if you have some information, and would that be the case? Would that affect some kind of I mean, the travels to the island what could be done in this respect from the U.S.?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Let me just say that its my understanding actually that Cuba has made a statement that there is cholera but that its under control in eastern part of Cuba. And so at this point, frankly, what we know is what weve seen as the press, as all of you have. I will say that obviously if there has been an outbreak of cholera, whether its under control or not, these this is the kind of information that we often put into I dont know that we will, but we often put into our Consular Information Sheets or Travel Warnings where they exist to make sure that Americans know about that possibility. But I dont know that thats been done yet or will need to be done. Well have to see how this develops.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Next question here, and then to you.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you very much. Im Lina Correa from Voice of America, also in Cuba. A few weeks ago the State Department asked for a humanitarian act in the case of Alan Gross. Have you received any answer from the Cuban Government about that? And also, how can the public opinion in United States value that U.S. policy with regard to Cuba when we cannot see any sign of change there?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Well, I think on the first question, on Alan Gross, youre quite right. We have actually repeatedly made a request of the Cuban Government to release Alan Gross on a humanitarian basis to be home with his family, to see his 90-year-old mother whos dying of cancer, and to attend to his own health issues. And no, we have not gotten an acceptable response at this point. And obviously he is not home with his family, so that has not occurred. Despite the fact that Mr. Gonzalez was permitted by the court to see his brother, who was ill, we have not gotten that kind of action from the Cuban Government on Mr. Grosss case.<\/p><p>On the issue of change in Cuba, I think one of the things that is always hard to judge is it is difficult for us sometimes to understand, where there may be change, how much change there may be. We obviously cant venture very far outside Havana very often, and that makes it difficult for us to know what may be happening in other parts of the country. There are a lot of economic changes that have been announced, that have been talked about, that have been rumored, but not as much thats actually been implemented and thats being seen, I think, on the ground and in peoples lives.<\/p><p>But I think its interesting, when you see Raul Castro going to VietnamVietnam, which is a country which has made significant changes and with which we obviously want to see even further changes on the political side, but economic changes have already been made there is no doubt, it seems to me, that there is continued discussion and studying and interest in changes in Cuba.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, we have not seen any conversation from the governments side of political changes. Lots of conversation about economic changes that may or may not make a huge difference in peoples lives, but no changes in the ability of people to express themselves freely, to organize into political parties, et cetera. And that I mean, that does not change our policy, nor do I think it denigrates it any way. But what it does mean, I think, is that continuing the people-to-people contact that we have had, the changes that this President made to the regulations both on travel and on remittances with Cuba, are important ones to try and engage with the Cuban people in the absence of our ability to engage and see change in the Cuban Government.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: We have time for one or two more questions. Well start here.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thanks. Martha Avila from RCN TV, Colombia. Whats your opinion about the security in Colombia today? In the last days, the FARC has increased the terrorist attacks in the country. How see the U.S. Government the situation? The security in Colombia is worse?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I dont think that thats a conclusion that I would draw yet at this point, and I certainly hope its one that I wont be drawing. We certainly have seen those attacks and we are concerned about them, and we obviously deplore the violence. I want to actually make just a side comment because I failed to mention it when Jose and I were talking. I want to also reject the violence against El Norte in Monterrey, against a newspaper there.<\/p><p>But in the case of the FARC in Colombia, I think that its very clear that that is not the way forward, that the government will handle these issues and handle them well. We have confidence in the Government of Colombia. But I dont think that anyone can yet draw a conclusion that security is worse in Colombia. And I certainly hope that will not be the case and that the FARC will not return to acts of violence such as they committed in the past, which obviously we deplored and continue to. And thats not the way ahead in Colombia.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi. Im Luciana Coelho, Folha de Sao Paulo, Brazil. Just to bring back to the OAS a little bit, there are some concern from a group of NGOs and even within the OAS that there are a group of countries organized to kind of, Id say, deflate the system and the OAS and its importance. And Brazil is in its group, and also Ecuador and others. So the situation in Paraguay and the divisions within the member countries since supposed risk of exacerbation of this movement. Id like to know if the U.S. is paying any attention to that, if there is any concern, and if you see that this could harm the inter-American system.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thank you for the question. I actually I think many of you may have seen some of the comments that I made, that our delegation made, and some of the things that were said at the OAS General Assembly in Cochabamba. In particular, the OAS the inter-American system on human rights came under just fierce attack, I mean just the fiercest Ive ever seen. And that is something that worries us enormously.<\/p><p>The heart in some respects, the heart of the Organization of American States and the thing that, in my opinion, it should be most proud of is the inter-American system on human rights the commission, the court, all of the processes that have been developed over the years. You may take issue with individual decisions. The United States is brought before the commission more than any other country in the hemisphere, and we very often dont agree with the decisions. But we will defend the commission and its right to act forever, because the system is not designed for a particular case. It is not designed for a particular government. Its designed to protect the constellation of rights and democratic freedoms that we have all agreed to against any kind of incursion. And sometimes those decisions are difficult for countries. But the discomfort is the price we pay for a system that defends all of us at various times and has defended very important issues of human rights in the last 40 years in this hemisphere.<\/p><p>So I think that the OAS General Assembly was of I mean, the conversations that we held there, I think, were of great concern to us. And moving forward, we want to find ways to strengthen and yes, reform, in part the inter-American human rights system, but not to destroy it.<\/p><p>And I will say I just want to be clear about this that unfortunately, it became clear at the General Assembly that some peoples goals wasnt reform. In fact, they didnt even use the words reform. They used the words destruction. And that to me it wasnt me interpreting those words; it was what was said. So having that out on the table, maybe now we can talk about how to reform the system and in fact continue to strengthen it, even when we dont like its decisions all the time, as will happen.<\/p><p>I do think that moving ahead on the issue of Paraguay, we have an opportunity here in the hemisphere. We have an opportunity to work together on an issue that concerns all of us, which is strengthening democracy and strengthening dialogue in Paraguay. I think the way the OAS has gone about this has been very healthy and very productive, but I think there are important roles for countries in South America. And we will continue to work, for example, with Brazil on this issue very closely. We will continue to be in contact with our colleagues in Chile, in Colombia, in Peru. All of those countries are important to moving this ahead and finding a constructive outcome, which I think everybody wants. We have had good conversations with our Uruguayan counterparts.<\/p><p>So I dont I see Paraguay in some ways as a way for us to come together as a region to support Paraguayan democracy, not as an issue which will exacerbate divisions.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Could you expand your comment regarding the attacks against El Norte, if possible?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Right. I mean, the only thing I want to say about that is we have seen, obviously, violence against journalists, individual journalists, but also against newspapers or other media outlets in Mexico in the past. These attacks just unfortunately sort of continue or take that to another level, and they have to be rejected by everyone. And one of the things that worries me the most in Mexico is the threat of physical violence, which causes both, obviously, an inability to report stories just because of physical harm but also leads to self-censorship, if were not careful, because of fear, a climate of fear.<\/p><p>And so I think that we all have to stand up and speak out against that kind of violence and hope to work with the government, because I think the current government has made it very clear that they dont accept those kinds of attacks and that they want to work on resolving those cases and reducing the incidents of violence against journalists and media outlets, and that well do everything we can to help in that area.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Im afraid were out of time. I want to thank Assistant Secretary Jacobson for coming here. I hope you return soon.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thank you very much.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you.<\/p><\/body>","1015":"Protests against Google \"allocating\" territories to ChinaIndia protests against Google \"allocating\" territories to China","340":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Bizarre scenes emerged Monday from Moscow as thousands of protesters chanting, \"Putin is a thief!\" and \"Down with the Czar!\" intermingled with costumed actors re-enacting scenes from Russian history to mark Russia Day, a national holiday.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">But that wasn't the only unusual aspect.<\/p><p>Mass protests are a rare occurrence in Russia -- the last ones of this scale took place in the winter of 2011-12 in response to allegations of widespread vote rigging in parliamentary elections. What makes the recent protests -- which first began in March -- significant is their reach, engulfing almost 100 cities across the country and including the participation of Russian youth, once thought to be politically apathetic.<\/p><p>Seventy children, in fact, were arrested in Moscow alone during a March protest.<\/p><p>But it's not just the youth. While convincing the middle-class intelligentsia of Moscow and St. Petersburg to take to the streets is one thing, opposition politician Alexei Navalny's call to action has resonated in poorer, less developed regions, long thought to be <person><nameText>Vladimir Putin's <\/nameText><\/person>stronghold.<\/p><p>Since he became president in 2000, Putin has consolidated his grip on power and thus is unlikely to be threatened by the recent protests. However, the Kremlin will undoubtedly be rattled by this new generation of political activism.<\/p><p>The protests in the winter of 2011-12 were followed by a harsh crackdown which fundamentally changed the nature of Russian political life. With Putin likely to run for a fourth term in the March 2018 presidential elections, the question now is whether the Russian authorities will respond the same way again.<\/p><p>Although young people here have only ever known <person><nameText>Putin's Russia, <\/nameText><\/person>the recent protests were notable for the unexpected number of their faces in the crowds. Barred from state TV, Navalny has taken to social media to get his message across, and it appears to have resonated among Russian youth -- a generation which lies beyond the reach of the potent state-owned media.<\/p><p>Almost 23 million people have watched a Russian-language version of a video expos\u00c3\u00a9 in which Navalny details the alleged corruption of Prime Minister Dimitry Medvedev. A spokeswoman for the Prime Minister has dismissed the claims made in the video as \"propaganda insinuations.\"<\/p><p>As Russian youth undergo a political awakening, the Kremlin appears to be resorting to old tactics. In the wake of the March protests, school children and university students across the country have reported being harassed and intimidated by the authorities.<\/p><p>Several parents have been charged with \"failure to execute child-rearing responsibilities\" for allowing their children to attend gatherings in May. And the Speaker of the upper house of the Russian Parliament suggested that parliamentary committees should look into banning children from unsanctioned protests altogether.<\/p><p>In a transparent attempt to woo the social media generation, RussianYouTube star Sasha Spilberg was invited to give a speech to a packed session of the Parliament last month. The move was part of an effort by Putin's United Russia party to \"prevent the use of young people as a driving force in protests.\"<\/p><p>To the envy of many an American politician, Navalny has not only struck a chord with young people. His campaigning on pocketbook issues which affect ordinary Russians has resonated in Russia's rust-belt cities as well.<\/p><p\/><p>A recent report by Credit Suisse found that Russia is the most unequal of the world's major economies. As the country emerges from a two-year recession, Navalny's reports of corruption by Russian politicians -- notably that of Medvedev -- has enabled him to reach deep into the Russian heartland.<\/p><p>While two-thirds of Russians hold Putin responsible for corruption, his approval ratings have stabilized at over 80% since the annexation of Crimea -- a hugely popular move in Russia. But the Prime Minister, who is seen as weak and responsible for Russia's economic woes, is an altogether easier target and provides the Kremlin with a ready scapegoat if necessary.<\/p><p>Some 1,500 people were arrested after the protests in March, but the turnout at Monday's demonstrations would suggest that protestors remain undeterred by the consequences -- something the Kremlin will be hard-pressed to ignore.<\/p><p>Human Rights Watch described as the crackdown following the 2011-12 protests as the worst since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Protest laws were tightened, while activists were harassed and imprisoned and Putin sought to blame then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for fermenting the unrest. New legislation branded many Russian NGOs as \"foreign agents\" if they receive funding from abroad -- often the only option available for Russian civil society organizations. Dozens were forced to close.<\/p><p>In search of a new narrative to rally the people around the President, Russian officials and the state-owned media began to talk of \"Russian traditional values,\" which were juxtaposed with the supposedly hedonic West. The centerpiece of this new narrative was the controversial gay propaganda law, passed in 2013 in what many believe was an attempt to find a domestic scapegoat for Russian frustrations.<\/p><p>The significance of the recent protests may well usher in change, but there is no guarantee that the change will be good. Democracy may continue to elude Russia -- for now at least.<\/p><\/body>","304":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON, May 19 -- US authorities have not made any arrests as hundreds of peaceful protestors in Seattle march against a Royal Dutch Shell oil rig at the Port of Seattle following protests throughout the weekend, the US Coast Guard told Sputnik.<\/p><p>'From maritime side of things including Saturday's demonstration and kayakers on the water there have been no arrests or detainees,' US Coast Guard Lieutenant Dana Warr said on Monday.

In some cities, protesters will march from Verizon stores to lawmakers' offices.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">The protests will highlight the company's role lobbying to kill rules that prevent telecom giants from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what internet users see and do through discriminatory throttling. Protesters will carry signs calling on their members of Congress to speak out against Verizon's attacks on Net Neutrality and publicly oppose the FCC's plan, which is expected to be released this week.<\/p><p>See the website announcing the protests here: VerizonProtests.com<\/p><p>Ajit Pai's plan is expected to contain a \"total repeal\" of Net Neutrality protections, posing a grave threat to the future of freedom of expression, access to information, and small businesses particularly for communities of color and low income communities.<\/p><p>The December 7 protests represent growing grassroots backlash to the FCC's plan, which polls show is wildly unpopular with people from across the political spectrum. The events are supported by Team Internet, a grassroots network of nearly half a million volunteer activists spearheaded by Demand Progress, Fight for the Future, and Free Press Action Fund, three of the groups behind the massive July 12 Net Neutrality day of action that drove millions of comments, emails, and phone calls to the FCC and Congress.<\/p><p>Over recent months the groups behind the protests have organized thousands of constituents to attend more than 600 town halls and meetings with lawmakers to demand their support for Net Neutrality. A phone call campaign through BattleForTheNet.com has generated nearly 250,000 phone calls to legislators offices.<\/p><p>At the protests participants will be encouraged to take a group photo and tweet it at their local members of Congress. Where possible, protesters will march to a nearby lawmaker's office and deliver petition signatures.<\/p><p>Protests are currently planned in Phoenix, Denver, San Francisco, New York City, Indianapolis, Boston, and several other cities across the country. They're being organized by volunteers in a grassroots manner using email, texting, and social media. Local internet users can volunteer to host a protest, and then connect with other volunteers in their area and encourage them to attend. There will be a special protest event in Washington, DC, details are TBA.<\/p><p>\"This is the free speech fight of our generation and internet users are pissed off and paying attention\" said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, \"Ajit Pai may be owned by Verizon, but he has to answer to Congress, and lawmakers have to answer to us, their constituents. The corrupt bureaucrats trying to kill Net Neutrality are hoping to avoid public backlash by burying the news over the Holiday weekend. We're taking our protest from the internet to the streets to make sure that doesn't happen,\" she added.<\/p><p>\"FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has been too busy meeting with industry lobbyists and greedy Verizon executives to hear the outcry from millions of people who are joining together to reject his plan to kill off Net Neutrality,\" said Free Press Action Fund Field Director Mary Alice Crim. \"People know that the open internet is essential for accessing everything from elder care to mental health services and they're willing to fight for it. That's why Team Internet members have met face-to-face with hundreds of members of Congress and their staff, organized others in their communities, and spoken out on behalf of Net Neutrality. This momentum of popular support will spill into the streets on Dec. 7 as people protest Pai and his corporate cronies outside Verizon stores nationwide. Our message to Pai and Verizon is clear: people everywhere will not sit idle as you destroy the free and open internet.\"<\/p><p>\"Americans are sick and tired of lawmakers placing the profits of monopolistic companies like Verizon and Comcast above the interests of ordinary people,\" said Mark Stanley, Director of Communications for Demand Progress. \"Outside Washington, support for strong Net Neutrality is widespread, regardless of political affiliation. Now, with what would be a catastrophic vote by the FCC to repeal Net Neutrality looming, people are ready to take to the streets in protest and to offer Congress one last chance to answer the question: 'Do you stand for your constituents' ability to communicate and connect, or do you stand for Verizon's bottom line?'\"<\/p><p>This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 21, 2017.<\/p><p>Contact: Timothy Karr, 201\/533-8838<\/p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services<\/p><p>MSTRUCK-6083739 MSTRUCK<\/p><\/body>","63":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\"\/><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Aug 27, 2014 (The Financial Services Club Blog:<url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.thefinanser.com\">http:\/\/www.thefinanser.com<\/url> Delivered by Newstex)<br\/> Building upon the previous two blog entries that discussed the new business models in banking based upon products (cloud-shared leveraging data analytics) and processing (real-time via open sourced APIs), we now arrive at the customer layer (mobile and social).<\/p><p><br\/><url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/thefinanser.co.uk\/.a\/6a01053620481c970b01a3fd2eead2970b-popup\">http:\/\/thefinanser.co.uk\/.a\/6a01053620481c970b01a3fd2eead2970b-popup<\/url><br\/> Seen as the most important layer, as this is where the relationship between provider and their client comes together, it is not.<br\/><br\/>It has an equitable status with the other two layers, and often people misinterpret the value of the end-user relationship.<br\/> Who owns the customer? they ask, but the more important question should be Who is the customer? <br\/> Right now, some banks should be targeting the likes of Simple (pre-BBVA takeover) and Moven as their customer, as these are the companies trying to deliver a great customer experience through social media and apps via mobile and tablet.<br\/> That is not all they are doing, but a Moven or Simple as a client of a bank processor or product provider, is just as important as a bank or provider delivering direct to the user.<br\/> Having said that, this final layer is where the rubber hits the road.<br\/> The mass volume processing of finance at a personalised level via the device of choice is where the real battle for the consumer will take place and, as I state in my latest presentations, connecting people to the network is where the business battle take place.<br\/> Last century, the battle was over electricity and connecting products to the grid. This century, the world has moved from products to connecting humans to the net.<br\/> And some firms will focus upon the human interface, whilst others will focus upon the content and process.<br\/>Amazon[1]\u00a0could not be the retailing giant it is today without the product providers ( publishers, manufacturers and stores) and processors (post offices and logistics firms) that it partners with.<br\/> In Amazon's retail business it produces no product and processes no fulfilment but, what it does do amazingly well, is leverages the client relationship by innovating with 100% focus upon the customer experience.<br\/> That is why I love Amazon.<br\/> Equally, when we look at Starbucks or Uber, they are well loved because they take away the friction of the process.<br\/> With Uber, my need is to get to B when I am stuck at A.<br\/> In the old world, I had to find the product (the taxi) at point A to get to point B and, when I arrived at point B, would have to manage the process (the payment) for the product.<br\/> What Uber does brilliantly is to take away the friction of consuming the product (taxi) and process (payment), so that all I have to do is think about getting to B as fast as possible from A.<br\/> That is why I love Uber and why London's licenced taxis hate it, organising a massive protest against the app.<br\/>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/thefinanser.co.uk\/.a\/6a01053620481c970b01a73de9ec32970d-popup\">http:\/\/thefinanser.co.uk\/.a\/6a01053620481c970b01a73de9ec32970d-popup<\/url><br\/> Intriguingly, on the day that they protested against Uber (June 11 2014), downloads of the Uber app increased 850%\u00a0[2]because people could not get a taxi.<br\/> That demonstration is like the dinosaur protesting against the impact of the ice age, and banks who try to do the same will feel the same impact.<br\/> Meanwhile, there will be banks that I will love in the future.<br\/> Banks that recognise they do not have to create any financial products, they just need to deliver them in the most customer intimate way.<br\/> There are already banks doing this.<br\/> Banks such as ICICI in India who take great financial products like SmartyPig and repackage them as iWish in Facebook.<br\/> Or banks like Fidor in Germany, who realise that processing across borders does not need them to build the capability.<br\/> They can just buy that capability off someone like hyperWALLET for cross-border payments, or BIPS for bitcoin payments, or loans via the P2P platform Smava.<br\/> This is the future playground for the provision of service, and it will revolutionize the bank front-end.<br\/> The integration of social mobile connectivity with apps and plug-and-play services that consumers and corporates can use as the best experience will be the battle.<br\/> A great example of how a bank is adapting to this battle is Deutsche Bank in fact.<br\/>Deutsche Bank has taken all of their components of corporate financing - supply chain management, account receivables, foreign exchange, cash management, etc - and broken them into over 150 component pieces deployed in the Deutsche Bank Autobahn appstore.[3]<br\/> These pieces are all apps that make the process of finance easy to track, trace and manage.<br\/> Corporate clients can then go to their Autobahn store and assemble their own pieces of treasury operations management into the dashboard of tools that best suit their business.<br\/> In this case, the client builds the front-end experience from the smorgasbord of components offered at the back end by their financial partner.<br\/> In this new world, the lines are blurred - when is the product a process, the API and app and the app a product? - but the simplistic way of viewing the future financial map as being products in the cloud using open sourced processes to deliver amazingly well packaged customer experiences, does at least provide a map for the future banking business.<br\/>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/thefinanser.co.uk\/.a\/6a01053620481c970b01a73de9ec53970d-popup\">http:\/\/thefinanser.co.uk\/.a\/6a01053620481c970b01a73de9ec53970d-popup<\/url><br\/> In my final piece on this structure, I will take a look at the way this changes the game overall.<br\/> [1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/thefinanser.co.uk\/fsclub\/2014\/05\/amazons-secret-sauce-customer-obsession.html\">http:\/\/thefinanser.co.uk\/fsclub\/2014\/05\/amazons-secret-sauce-customer-obsession.html<\/url> [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/uk\/home-news\/uber-signups-increase-850-as-black-cab-drivers-stage-london-taxi-protest-9530061.html\">http:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/uk\/home-news\/uber-signups-increase-850-as-black-cab-drivers-stage-london-taxi-protest-9530061.html<\/url> [3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https:\/\/autobahn.db.com\/microSite\/html\/autobahn_mobile.html\">https:\/\/autobahn.db.com\/microSite\/html\/autobahn_mobile.html<\/url><\/p><p\/><\/body>","1113":"Strike against Walmart in Los AngelesWal-Mart faces wage lawsuit as walkout","1107":"Strike against Walmart in Los AngelesWal-Mart faces wage lawsuit as walkout threat looms","173":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Hay and grass seed cover the bare spots on the lawn in front of the stately old City Hall where Occupy Charlotte's camp held its ground for nearly four months. The occupiers are gone now and the protest movement quieted after arrests, a new anticamping ordinance and, to a degree, the group's own missteps along the way.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">But as the grass begins to take root, so does a resilient Occupy Charlotte. A small group still meets regularly in the city, participating in targeted protests and planning for some critical dates already circled on the calendar: May 9, when the annual Bank of America shareholders meeting is held in Charlotte, and, more important, Sept. 3, when the Democratic National Convention comes to town.<\/p><p>Every four years, the political conventions become magnets for mass protests, but this year the Occupy movement has added an unpredictable element to the mix. In Charlotte, the movement has already shown its clout through hundreds of protesters in October who gathered to demonstrate against Bank of America and a resulting encampment on the lawn in front of old City Hall.<\/p><p>But the Occupy movement here has been beset by troubles.<\/p><p>There was infighting over leadership within the group at the start, and there were repeated public relations gaffes. A flag burning in December split the group, and undermined acceptance and support within a skeptical Charlotte community as well.<\/p><p>Occupy Charlotte's encampment may have had the unintended effect of getting the authorities prepared for convention protests; officials began planning a series of ordinances to manage such demonstrations after Occupy began.<\/p><p>''To be honest with you,'' said Robert E. Hagemann, the city attorney, ''I'm not sure we would have thought to prohibit camping as part of our ordinances had Occupy not happened.''<\/p><p>On Jan. 23, the Democratic-controlled Charlotte City Council passed the ordinances, including a camping ban, on a 10-to-1 vote. A week later, Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officers crossed the street from their headquarters and arrested seven people on the way to dismantling the camp.<\/p><p>''We're the second-largest financial services center in the country, so it didn't take a rocket scientist to think that we would see the activity here as well,'' <person><nameText>Mayor Anthony Foxx <\/nameText><\/person>said of the Occupy Charlotte movement. ''But we've handled it, I think, as well or better than any community across the country.''<\/p><p>Not everyone would agree. Occupy Charlotte members said city officials tried to discredit the group, saying the protest movement had cost the police $447,000 to monitor during the encampment. Ken Davies, a Charlotte lawyer, sought a temporary restraining order to allow Occupy Charlotte to return to camp, but it was not granted. He is now seeking an injunction.<\/p><p>Occupy Charlotte members have continued to meet regularly and arrange smaller protests, including a recent daylong event outside a Bank of America branch in town. But without the camp, the number of active members has dwindled just as planning for the convention kicks into high gear.<\/p><p>''We're definitely at our low point,'' said Scottie Wingfield, 36, of Charlotte, an Occupy member. ''I would say about 25, and when we started out, our first marches were 600, 700.''<\/p><p>''We have the spring shareholders meeting at Bank of America coming here in May, so I imagine we'll have a lot of people wanting to participate in that,'' she said. ''And then of course the D.N.C. So I think participation will go back up.''<\/p><p>Bill Dobbs, a member of Occupy Wall Street's press team, said there is continuing communication with Occupy Charlotte members as they plan bank and convention protests. And as many as 60 groups have signed on to join the Coalition to Protest at the D.N.C. In Florida, Occupy Tampa is involved in planning similar efforts for the Republican National Convention, which will be held there in August, but the group has had smaller protests than those in Charlotte and the city has proposed a ''clean zone'' limiting where demonstrations can be held.<\/p><p>In planning protests this time around, for the conventions, social media is likely to play a bigger role.<\/p><p>''I think there's been a lot more inter-occupation communication as people got away from the encampments and starting getting online and establishing lines of communication across the country,'' said Domenic Battistella, 34, of nearby Mooresville, an original member of Occupy Charlotte. ''We're going to be much more coordinated on a regional basis.''<\/p><p>Occupy Charlotte members recently met with Occupy protesters from throughout North Carolina to prepare for the convention and are planning to provide housing, food and other support for those who come from out of state. An Occupy Durham member is now helping the legal team in a potential challenge as Charlotte officials continue to hold off allowing groups to apply for permits to protest at the convention.<\/p><p>Michael Zytkow, 25, an Occupy Charlotte member, said the May 9 protest at the Bank of America meeting could draw Occupy members from as far as Michigan and Washington State, as well as labor groups, others protesting the bank's foreclosures and environmental groups focused on the bank's financing of the coal industry. Mr. Zytkow hopes the protest draws as many as 1,000 people, providing a test run for the convention and the city's ability to control the demonstrations.<\/p><p>And how many will come for the convention?<\/p><p>''I'm guessing in the thousands upon thousands,'' Mr. Zytkow said.<\/p><\/body>","1501":"Chicago as drivers protest USA TODAY'With this money, I cannot survive': Uber, Lyft strike hits L.A., NYC, Boston, Chicago as drivers protest USA TODAY","1431":"Paris Protest Against GoogleActivists in Paris Protest Against Google's Tax Setup","1473":"Protest against Google in LondonNursing mothers stage climate protest against Google in London","1035":"Stage demonstration of GoogleGoogle unveils Internet television platform","496":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Brazilians swept through the streets across the country Sunday for an anti-government protest demanding the removal of <person><nameText>President Dilma Rousseff.<\/nameText><\/person><br\/>Called out mostly by activist groups via social media, Sunday's protests were sparked by their anger over an eroding economy and a corruption scandal that has implicated politicians in Rousseff's Workers Party, leaving Rousseff fighting for her political life, according to Fox News Latino.<\/p><p><br\/>Many marched wearing the green, yellow and blue colors of Brazil.

A breakthrough in negotiations over the cost of health care reform. Members of the Senate Finance Committee say they found ways to trim the cost to less than $1 trillion.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Congressional correspondent Brianna Keilar, live from Capitol Hill, with details.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Brianna, why don't you get us started here. What are you learning?<\/p><p>BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Tony, this really is a significant development. Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee, which has really been seen as the best for getting bipartisan agreement, some bipartisan agreement on health care overhaul, they've been crunching numbers for the better part of a week, here, working with the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, the CBO, trying to figure out a way to get this whole thing down to a price tag that is feasible. Last week, they were told the plan that Democrats on this committee put out was 1.6 trillion dollars, which is really just prohibitively expensive.<\/p><p>And so here's the announcement today from Senator Max Baucus, the chairman for this committee, saying that they have reached some options for things they can do to be at the price tag they want.<\/p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>SEN. MAX BAUCUS (D), FINANCE CHAIRMAN: The CBO now tells us we have options that would enable us to write a one trillion dollar bill, fully paid for. We have options -- we have ways to, according to the CBO today, fully pay for this bill.<\/p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP<\/p><p>KEILAR: And an aide to the senator tells us that these options that they're looking at, under them, 97 percent of Americans, they are confident, will be covered by a health care overhaul that they're planning.<\/p><p>TONY HARRIS, CNN ANCHOR: Wow.<\/p><p>KEILAR: But now you heard him say, Tony, we have options. HARRIS: Yes.<\/p><p>KEILAR: And we're really looking for specifics, because that's what we want. But we don't know exactly what those specifics are, how are they going to pay for it, and what exactly is it going to look like. We still want to know.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Yes, yes. We do know this committee is getting closer to an answer on both of these questions, correct?<\/p><p>KEILAR: Yes, no, we do. We know that one of the things they have been looking at, and seems to be gaining traction, is the idea of taxing employer-provided health benefits. Now, we heard from Senator Chuck Grassley, the ranking Republican member on this committee. He said yesterday that one of the ideas they're looking at is for a family of four, for their health benefits package, if it were to exceed 17,000 dollars, which is very far above the national average for health benefits -- this would be considered a Cadillac Plan -- that you might tax them on the amount that goes over a certain -- that goes over 17,000 dollars.<\/p><p>So, that's one of the things they're looking at. But the exact formula, that's just him talking about one of the things they're looking at. We don't know what the exact formula is going to end up like. And then looking at what the plan may be, we talked a lot, Tony, about this health co-op idea; this is seems to be what members, Republicans and Democrats on this committee, are coalescing around, the idea of a non-profit health co-op, instead of a government-run insurance plan.<\/p><p>HARRIS: I'm sorry. I'm taking notes as you're speaking here. And we'll get to this whole idea of taxing employer-provided health benefits. We'll talk about that later. What's the sticking point on how to structure the idea of a health co-op, Brianna?<\/p><p>KEILAR: Yes, we're really focused on this, because, when it comes down to it, you want to know exactly what their plan is. How to pay for it is important. But what is it going to look like? This idea of a health co-op, the different issues that you're seeing are some liberal Democrats want a very strong federal hand in this. They want this to have enough teeth that it can compete against private insurers, and, in their opinion, through that, bring the cost down.<\/p><p>But what you have is senators like Chuck Grassley who are very fearful of that. They are fearful for what that will mean, and that it will drive private insurers out of the market. So they want a light federal touch, and at this point it's really striking that balance between these two groups.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Boy, oh boy, breaking developments. Great reporting, Brianna; appreciate it. Thank you. We'll get back to you later in the hour.<\/p><p>Let's get right to the White House to the health care developments. On the Hill, White House correspondent Suzanne Malveaux joining us live. Suzanne, you know the question's coming; how is all this playing out at the White House?<\/p><p>SUZANNE MALVEAUX, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, sure. Speaking with White House officials, they don't normally react to every little incremental step along the way here. Obviously, they're paying very close attention to what has happened.<\/p><p>This is good news. Make no mistake about it, this is very good news, because basically the one thing that the president has told members of Congress is don't come to me with a bill that you can't pay for.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Right.<\/p><p>MALVEAUX: And essentially if it is -- if it does not contribute to the federal deficit, if it is able to be paid for on its own -- deficit neutral is the term they like to use here -- well, then, that is a bill that the president is willing to sign. He has said it before.<\/p><p>So, obviously this is a very good development from the White House perspective. And then secondly, Brianna was mentioning one of those options, the possibility of putting a cap on the benefits, health care benefits, that are tax free.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Yes.<\/p><p>MALVEAUX: That is something that the president, as candidate Obama, did not agree with, did not support. Since becoming president, he's been holding a lot of these discussions, the back-and-forth with members on the Hill, there is a little bit of wiggle room here. There's a little bit of room for flexibility.<\/p><p>So, that is something that the White House is looking at and not completely dismissing. So, there's some movement here that is happening on both sides. And this is seen as a good development from the White House perspective, Tony.<\/p><p>HARRIS: And, Suzanne, I know that there was a White House event last night, where health care was the one and only topic. How did that play out?<\/p><p>MALVEAUX: Well, it was really kind extraordinary, the kind of access, a television network holding its own town hall, if you will, in the White House parlor, in the family room, as the anchors had noted, clearly underscoring that the president is just trying to get his message out any way possible, to put pressure on members of Congress, get this thing done by the fall.<\/p><p>This is considered a key window. If it doesn't happen now, Tony, they don't think it is going to happen. So, they've been pushing and pushing. And what we heard from the president last night is that yes, he acknowledges it will cost a lot, but he believes that there are ways to pay for this. I want you to take a listen.<\/p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What I've said is let's change the system so that our overall cost curve starts going down, by investing in a range of things, prevention, health IT, et cetera.<\/p><p>We will have some up front costs. And the estimates, as Charlie has said, have been anywhere from a trillion to two trillion dollars. But what we've said is, what my administration has said, what I've said, is that whatever it is that we do, we pay for, so it doesn't add to our deficit.<\/p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>MALVEAUX: And, Tony, Brianna brought up a very good point. She laid out in great detail what some of the possibilities are for raising that revenue. We've already heard from the president talking about making serious cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and some expenditures for hospitals, Tony.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Boy, a lot of news, a lot of developments here. At the White House for us, Suzanne Malveaux, appreciate it. Thanks so much.<\/p><p>MALVEAUX: Thanks, Tony.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Let's keep the health care reform drumbeat going. Good to see you. All right, a rally for health care reform is taking place on Capitol Hill. It is sponsored by this organization, Health Care for America Now. The group describes itself as a grassroots campaign made up of 1,000 organizations, representing 30 million people. Health Care for America Now says it supports comprehensive, affordable health care, including a government plan to compete with private insurance.<\/p><p>You know, health care reform, it is an incredibly confusing, complex issue. We are doing our best with it. We asked the chairman of Emory University School of Public Health what he'd do to reform health care. Here's Kenneth Thorpe's 90-second RX.<\/p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>KENNETH THORPE, EMORY UNIVERSITY: Here's my RX for the health care crisis. I'd focus on five points.<\/p><p>First, we've got to get the cost of health care under control. And one way to do that is by preventing disease in the first place. Thirty percent of the growth in health care spending in this country is due to the doubling of obesity in the United States since 1985.<\/p><p>Two, we need to do a better job of managing and working with chronically ill patients, people with Diabetes and high blood pressure. They account for 75 percent of health care spending. They have high rates of hospital admissions and re-admissions, many of which are preventable.<\/p><p>The third thing that I would do is focus on administrative costs. Our administrative costs are too high. Our system is too complicated. We need to simplify this system, so that we can reduce the cost of health care and allow physicians and patients to spend more time clinically, rather than filing claims forms and dealing with paper.<\/p><p>The fourth thing we need to do is provide more information. We know very little, ironically, about what clinical treatments work best and how much they cost. Physicians and patients and families need that information to make more appropriate health care choices.<\/p><p>And the fifth thing I would do is we have to deal with the 47 million people who don't have health insurance coverage in this country. So, we have to find a solution that is bipartisan to cover all Americans. I'm hopeful this time around in the health care reform debate that everybody's second choice is not the status quo, but we can really compromise and this time finally cover all Americans.<\/p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>HARRIS: OK. Ahead in the CNN NEWSROOM, the new president of the American Medical Association answers our questions about health care reform. Dr. James Rohack, his concerns and suggestions, 12:45 p.m. Eastern time.<\/p><p>Back to today's other top story, a ceremony to remember victims of these two weeks of protests has been postponed, according to the website of one political party.<\/p><p>Also, Iran's president has some sharp criticism for President Obama. Our international correspondent, Ivan Watson, is at the Iran desk here in the CNN NEWSROOM. And, Ivan, what can you tell us about this warning the Iranian president has for President Obama?<\/p><p>IVAN WATSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, well, he definitely accused President Obama of interfering in Iran's internal affairs. He said that -- this is in response to President Obama's recent criticism of the bloody crackdown that we've seen over the past week and a half in Iran.<\/p><p>Let me read you some of this quote that came out. Quote, \"we don't expect much from British governments and other European governments, whose records and backgrounds are known for everybody and have no dignity. But I wonder why Mr. Obama, who has come with the slogan of change, has fallen into this trap and has taken the same route that Bush took and experienced its consequences.\"<\/p><p>So, going right after the U.S. president and western governments, who have also been accused of organizing plots to destabilize Iran over the last week and a half, Tony.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Hey, Ivan, what are you hearing about further crackdowns on dissents and journalists being detained?<\/p><p>WATSON: Yes, let me take you to a photo of --<\/p><p>HARRIS: Sure.<\/p><p>WATSON: -- a Greek -- British journalist freelancer, Jassen Apenjadis (ph). And he's been detained over the past couple of days. His Greek parents have called for his release, as has the Greek Foreign Ministry. He is just one of scores of journalists who have been arrested, mostly Iranians.<\/p><p>Let's listen to this media watchdog agency out of Paris, Reporters Without Borders, what they have to say, Tony.<\/p><p>HARRIS: OK.<\/p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>JEAN-FRANCOIS JULLIARD, REPORTERS WITHOUT BORDERS: Actually, the situation now is that 59 Iranian journalists have been arrested; 59 journalists are currently detained in Iran. And the situation is -- is getting worse for foreign journalists as well, because most of the foreign journalists have already left Iran.<\/p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>WATSON: And, of course, as you've heard from our own Reza Sayah how difficult and oppressive the climate was like for journalists to operate on the ground --<\/p><p>HARRIS: Yes.<\/p><p>WATSON: -- over the past couple weeks, Tony.<\/p><p>HARRIS: And we'll talk a bit more about that with Reza in just a minute. Ivan, appreciate it. Thank you.<\/p><p>As mentioned, Reza Sayah was in Iran covering these demonstrations. He's been forced to get out of the country.

Today's economic news for you; first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose unexpectedly last week to the highest level in more than a month. The Labor Department said 627,000 Americans filed initial claims, up 15,000 from the previous week.<\/p><p>And a slightly improved reading on Gross Domestic Product; the Commerce Department says first-quarter GDP shrank 5.5 percent less than the previous estimate of 5.7 percent.

I did not play a role in arranging this transaction, and no Federal Reserve assistance was promised or provided in connection with that agreement. As with similar transactions, the transaction was agreed and approved by the Federal Reserve, under the Bank Holding Company Act in November 2008. It was subsequently approved by the shareholders of Bank of America and Merrill Lynch on December 5th.<\/p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>HARRIS: Bernanke's comments come exactly two weeks after B of A CEO Ken Lewis delivered his side of the story in front of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.<\/p><p>Well, you think the job market now is bad? Just wait until the economy recovers. Where are we going here? CNN personal finance editor, Gerri Willis, is here to tell us about the new threat to the job market. All right, Gerri, I'm all ears.<\/p><p>GERRI WILLIS, CNN PERSONAL FINANCE EDITOR: All right, well, think about it, Tony. All right, if you're looking for a job right now, you know you're competing with unemployed workers in your industry. But according to a new study, once the recovery takes hold, well, you may have even more competition. More than half of workers employed right now, 54 percent, say they will start looking for a new job once the economy turns around. That's according to an HR consultancy, Adeco Group.<\/p><p>And almost three-quarters, three quarters, of Gen-Y workers are ready to jump ship. We spoke to Joanie Ruge, who says all the benefit cutting companies have been doing are taking a toll on their workers.<\/p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>JOANIE RUGE, SENIOR VP, ADECCO: All of those cuts have had an impact on employee morale. The feel like, OK, my employer has made so many cuts on benefits and perks and salary, should I go somewhere else?<\/p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) HARRIS: All right, so we've been seeing more and more companies halting 401(K) matches, putting on hiring freezes, salary freezes. And once we get closer to the end of the recession, that's not likely to be rolled back. According to Watson-Wyatt, one in five employers will keep salary reductions in place; 46 percent do not plan to reverse the increases in how much employees pay for health care premiums.<\/p><p>So some of these bad times, Tony, they're here to stay.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Yes, yes, I think you're absolutely right about that. So, what to you do if you're one of these people desperate to get out of your current job?<\/p><p>WILLIS: Well, get started now. The fact that so many people will be looking to jump ship when the economy recovers means that you want to get your search under way as soon as possible. Figure out what companies you will target. Find a way to get them to see your work or become familiar with your name.<\/p><p>And if you're working, it's easier. Get involved with trade and professional organizations. Use social media to boost your profile within your network.<\/p><p>HARRIS: OK. Real solid advice now for you, Gerri; let's say you are looking for another job and you're still employed.<\/p><p>WILLIS: Right.<\/p><p>HARRIS: What are some of the big no-nos? Help people here.<\/p><p>WILLIS: Well, OK. You don't want to be going off on your hour long lunch break all the time. And that suit you're wearing to go visit the dentist, people know something's up out there, right?<\/p><p>HARRIS: Right, right, right.<\/p><p>WILLIS: With the unemployment rate at 9.4 percent, you're better off if you do have a job. Save the interviews for after work. Don't put your resume on your work computer. Most employers, as we've talked about before here, Tony, monitor what websites you visit. They know. And nearly a third of employers have fired employees for misusing the Internet. That's according to the AMA.<\/p><p>Don't forget to look within your own company for opportunities before you jump ship. You know, think twice. Maybe it's not as bad as you think. And maybe you can ask for more responsibilities, a better title, better pay where you are right now.<\/p><p>HARRIS: That's a great point. Gerri, great advice. Great tips, as always. See you next time.<\/p><p>WILLIS: Thank you.<\/p><p>HARRIS: All right, Gerri. And as always, let's get you to CNNMoney.com. Check out our special report, America's Money Crisis.

CNN senior correspondent Allan Chernoff introduces us to one couple and tells us how they were hit and how they responded.<\/p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)<\/p><p>ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Not only were Kevin and Lucy Aikman heavily invested in the stock market last fall, but Kevin's employer, AIG, nearly collapsed. Kevin is in a stable end of the business, home insurance assessments; so the dual crisis rocking his investments and employer was especially jarring.<\/p><p>KEVIN AIKMAN, AIG EMPLOYEE: First thought is fear. What about all these years I've put in the hard work? All the money I've invested; is there going to be anything left at the end of the day?<\/p><p>CHERNOFF: For Lucy, the financial crisis has been terrifying.<\/p><p>LUCY AIKMAN, HIT HARD BY FINANCIAL CRISIS: Terrible anxiety. I -- I ended up having to go get pills because I couldn't sleep. So much anxiety.<\/p><p>CHERNOFF: Lucy lost her job as a trader on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange two years ago, and hasn't worked since. Her grown daughter also lost her job, as did Lucy's sister, who worked at Bear Stearns when it collapsed.<\/p><p>L. AIKMAN: Everybody's fearful, and everybody's falling like soldiers around me.<\/p><p>CHERNOFF (on camera): Just a few days before the stock market began collapsing last September, the Aikmans hired a contractor to chop down trees and excavate a pond by their home. Today, more than seven months later, it's still a hole in the ground. The project is on hold.<\/p><p>(voice-over:) The hole in the ground was like a hole in their pocket. It had cost 10,000 dollars. So the Aikmans chopped their spending. They gave up their personal trainer, and now exercise on their own. They postponed plans to build a screened porch, don't go out to dinner as much, and planted a vegetable garden.<\/p><p>L. AIKMAN: One of our biggest expenses is food. I mean, it sounds strange, but we eat a lot of fresh produce. And as you know, to eat healthfully, it costs money.<\/p><p>CHERNOFF: They've become more conservative investors, with help of financial planners Doug Plin and Rich Zito, who reduced their exposure to stocks.<\/p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We took it all the way down to about 15 percent stocks. If you're losing sleep, then you probably don't have the right portfolio. We need to find the right portfolio for you.<\/p><p>CHERNOFF: To sleep better, the Aikmans bought extra insurance, and Kevin is shelving his dreams of retiring in just ten years, when he'll be 55.<\/p><p>K. AIKMAN: The 401(k) just about fell in half. So when that happened, I reassessed and said, well, maybe I'm going to need to put a few more years in.<\/p><p>CHERNOFF: The Aikmans realize they can't control the economic environment that affects all of. But by cutting spending and boosting insurance, and becoming more conservative with investments, the Aikmans feel they are controlling what they can to weather the financial storm, while still being positioned to profit as it begins to pass.<\/p><p>Allan Chernoff, CNN, New York.<\/p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)<\/p><p>HARRIS: You can catch \"Money &amp; Main Street\" tonight at 8:00 p.m. Eastern on Campbell Brown.<\/p><p>He witnessed the ruthless crackdown.

Security forces crushing the latest protests against presidential election results. A ceremony today remembering victims of the two weeks of demonstrations has been postponed according to the website of one of the defeated presidential candidates.<\/p><p>Let's put all of this Iranian turmoil into some kind of context here. Our Reza Sayah has joined me.<\/p><p>And, Reza, you were -- when did you leave the country?<\/p><p>REZA SAYAH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I left . . .<\/p><p>HARRIS: When were you forced out of the country?<\/p><p>SAYAH: Yesterday. Yesterday. They gave me an ultimatum. And I think it's important to clarify that.<\/p><p>HARRIS: So you could have stayed?<\/p><p>SAYAH: I could have stayed, but they said, if you stay, we can't guarantee your safety. And they wanted me to . . .<\/p><p>HARRIS: Well, that means leave.<\/p><p>SAYAH: Yes. I mean, and I think, you know, that was a decision we made. Considering the way they delivered that message, the tone by which they delivered that message, we thought it was best to leave and that's what we did.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Reza, talk to me about your working as a correspondent doing your job, in a country where the regime does not want you to do what you're doing. At some point, you have to sense that the hammer is coming. You clearly had gotten word that, well, restrictions have been placed on your reporting. Then the ultimatum comes. How does it come? Is it a knock at the door?<\/p><p>SAYAH: It was a phone call. It was a phone call by the ministry that handles press credentials. And we had a relatively good rapport with them. But they said 4:00 p.m. Tuesday, you have to meet somebody. We said, who is it? They said, we can't tell you who it is, just show up. So we didn't know who this was that . . .<\/p><p>HARRIS: You were given a destination and you were told to show up?<\/p><p>SAYAH: Yes. But I'm an optimist by nature and I thought maybe this is our opportunity to convince them to get us back on air. So I was very optimistic going in. But, still, a little anxious about who this person was.<\/p><p>We arrive at 4:00 p.m. I was with our producer, who's still there. And they told me, he just wants to meet with you alone.<\/p><p>So, walk into this office. And very large, burly man sitting there on a couch with briefcase.<\/p><p>HARRIS: What, in a suit? In camouflage?<\/p><p>SAYAH: No, no, no.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Jack (ph) boots? What, what, what's going on here?<\/p><p>SAYAH: No, just wearing street clothes.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Right.<\/p><p>SAYAH: And I -- as soon as I get in, I start talking to him, giving him my spiel, trying to convince him this is why CNN need to be there reporting on the ground. So after my spiel he said, are you finished. I said, yes, I'm finished.<\/p><p>HARRIS: So he listened?<\/p><p>SAYAH: He listened. But then he said, are you finished? I said, yes. He goes, we have evidence that you have violated the ban on reporting. The ban that went into effect on Saturday. And we had not been on air. And he couldn't substantiated how we violated the ban, but he kept saying we have evidence that you violated that ban. But, he said, we can let bygones be bygones. HARRIS: Really?<\/p><p>SAYAH: But here's what you need to do. That's when he slid in front of me . . .<\/p><p>HARRIS: The ultimatum.<\/p><p>SAYAH: A piece of paper and a pen. He goes, I need you to write down on this piece of paper that I will no longer do any reports in Iran unless they are positive reports. And if you don't sign this agreement, he said, you have 24 hours to leave. If you don't leave, we can no longer guarantee your safety and we can't guarantee that you can come back and report in Iran.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Wow.<\/p><p>SAYAH: And that's when we made a decision that was difficult for me, because there's no way I wanted to leave at such a crucial juncture.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Right.<\/p><p>SAYAH: But we made the decision to get out of there.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Reza, appreciate it. Thanks for putting us in that room.<\/p><p>SAYAH: Sure.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Pretty dramatic stuff.<\/p><p>All right, Reza Sayah back from Tehran.<\/p><p>Want to get you a quick update on our financial picture today.

South Carolina's Republican governor, <person><nameText>Mark Sanford, <\/nameText><\/person>is facing hard questions today. Did taxpayers cover the costs of trips to Argentina where he carried on an extramarital affair? And did his dalliance destroy his future in national politics? Here's senior political correspondent Candy Crowley.<\/p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)<\/p><p>CANDY CROWLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT, (voice over): Turns out the tale of the South Carolina governor gone missing is a cliche.<\/p><p>GOV. <person><nameText>MARK SANFORD, <\/nameText><\/person>(R) SOUTH CAROLINA: So, the bottom line is this -- I -- I've been unfaithful to my wife.<\/p><p>CROWLEY: A collective groan from Republicans as another of their promising new faces on the national scene goes down the tubes.<\/p><p>RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: I wonder if Sanford thought that he was going to get away with this? They all do, I guess. He could have been our JFK.<\/p><p>CROWLEY: In a rambling, halting, teary news conference, Governor <person><nameText>Mark Sanford <\/nameText><\/person>copped to a string of bad behavior, including a 5,000-mile lie. His hike along the Appalachian Trail was a trek to Buenos Aires, reportedly to this apartment complex for a rendezvous with a longtime friend he says became a lover over the past year.<\/p><p>SANFORD: I have seen her three times since then, during that whole sparking thing.<\/p><p>CROWLEY: Mrs. Sanford knew about the sparking thing and said in a written statement she asked her husband to leave two weeks ago, but he'd earned a chance to resurrect the marriage.<\/p><p>SANFORD: So it had been back and forth and back and forth and back and forth. And the one thing that you really find is that you absolutely want resolution. And so, oddly enough, I spent the last five days of my life crying in Argentina.<\/p><p>CROWLEY: There's more. E-mails between Sanford and his lover, obtained by \"The State\" newspaper in South Carolina. The paper said the authenticity of the e-mails was confirmed by the governor's office. A spokesman for the governor would neither confirm nor deny authenticity to CNN.<\/p><p>\"You are my love,\" she wrote him. \"Something hard to believe even for myself as it's also a kind of impossible love.\" \"You have a level of sophistication,\" he wrote her, \"that's so fitting with your beauty. I could digress and say that you have the ability to give magnificent, gentle kisses, or that I love your tan lines.\"<\/p><p>In Republican circles everywhere, the wince factor is high. Damage control 101, sympathy and prayers, followed by as much distance as you can find. With warp speed, the Republican Governors Association accepted Sanford's resignation as head of the RGA. Ten days ago, Senate Republicans were just as quick, accepting John Ensign's resignation from his Senate leadership post.<\/p><p>SEN. JOHN ENSIGN, (R) NEVADA: Last year I had an affair.<\/p><p>CROWLEY: Also new to the national stage, Ensign, like Sanford, was sometimes talked about as a 2012 dark horse.<\/p><p>ALEX CASTELLANOS, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: It seems like a lot of our new leaders seem to be self-immolating.<\/p><p>CROWLEY: Good grief, said a Republican strategist, they're dropping like flies.<\/p><p>Candy Crowley, CNN, Washington.<\/p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)<\/p><p>HARRIS: Public lives, private indiscretions or so they think. Why do powerful men cheat and why do they think they can hide affairs in this age of the Internet and instant news? That was the topic on CNN's \"Larry King Live\" last night.<\/p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>LARRY KING, \"LARRY KING LIVE\": Why, Robert, do -- is the draw -- it's so powerful, it draws someone like the governor into this kind of situation?<\/p><p>ROBERT WEISS, THE SEXUAL RECOVERY INSTITUTE: I think it makes perfect sense that it would be a governor or someone like that who would be doing this, because people in power positions aren't often taking good care of themselves or the basic things they need to attend to, like their family lives. And so they get distracted by pleasurable experiences -- drugs, alcohol, sex -- and they're often running because they're not taking care of themselves. So it makes sense that he would drift into something because he . . .<\/p><p>KING: More than say a mailman would?<\/p><p>DR. DREW PINSKY, RELATIONSHIP SPECIALIST: I may address (ph) that a little bit too because the kind of person that seeks celebrity, seeks this kind of static, public life tends to me more in the narcissistic spectrum. And narcissism by itself isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it carries liabilities. People tend to feel special, entitled. They become compartmentalized, like Rob Weiss says. And the fact is, they may do things and really not perceive that they're having a consequence on other people.<\/p><p>KING: Dr. Saltz, why do you think they do it?<\/p><p>DR. GAIL SALTZ, PSYCHIATRIST: Well, I think, Larry, actually, politicians are often risk takers in addition to being potentially narcissistic people. I think it works for them in their career. You know, they push the edge. They take risks. And that helps them in their profession.<\/p><p>But, you know, the downside of that is just that, they need the constant stimulation. They want it. They're willing to push the edge.<\/p><p>This particular politician, as a matter of fact, made a lot of enemies and took a lot of risks and did a lot of things that were edgy. And so I think in a way it's not surprising. And this is why I think we're often seeing politicians doing this kind of thing.<\/p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>HARRIS: Wow, \"Larry King Live\" tonight, Elizabeth Edwards, the wife of the former presidential candidate, John Edwards.

CNN has just learned that actress Farrah Fawcett has passed away after a longtime battle with anal cancer. Our senior medical correspondent, Elizabeth Cohen, is here.<\/p><p>And, boy, Elizabeth, she tried everything.<\/p><p>ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: She did.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Over many, many years to try to beat back this cancer.<\/p><p>COHEN: She was a true empowered patient. She did not just do what doctors told her. She did what she was told and then went and found other things on her own.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Yes.<\/p><p>COHEN: She really fought hard. She was diagnosed with anal cancer in 2006. In 2007 she was told that she had gone in to remission. But then later in 2007, she was told that the cancer was back and then that it had metastasized to her liver.<\/p><p>When anal cancer spreads like that, there is a less than 20 percent chance that someone will still be alive five years later.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Wow. All right. So the news just coming in to CNN that actress Farrah Fawcett has died. She passed away this morning, 9:28 Pacific Time. An enormous star of the first order. A.J. Hammer remembers the life, the career, of Farrah Fawcett.<\/p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We proudly welcome to the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Miss Farrah Fawcett.<\/p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whoa! Farrah baby. Yes.<\/p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Farrah, look up. A.J. HAMMER, CNN CORRESPONDENT, (voice over): Farrah Fawcett will be remembered as one of the sexiest women of the 1970s. Her poster hung in the bedrooms of teenage boys around the country.<\/p><p>FARRAH FAWCETT: Hi, fellas. What are you playing?<\/p><p>HAMMER: And her breakout role as one of \"Charlie's Angels\" made her a star.<\/p><p>Fawcett was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, in 1947 and made her way to Hollywood as a 21-year-old. The blond beauty was soon dating TV star Lee Majors and appearing in commercials and on various TV shows.<\/p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mrs. Latrin (ph), this is Miss Perry (ph), my secretary.<\/p><p>HAMMER: She married and became Farrah Fawcett-Majors in 1973. And then she had her first big break.<\/p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Once upon a time, there were three little girls who . . .<\/p><p>HAMMER: In 1976, \"Charlie's Angels\" made its debut, and she was the blond. The top-rated Aaron Spelling show about three female private detectives grabbed the nation's attention. Farrah's face started showing up on magazine covers and even lunch boxes. And a poster of her in a swimsuit sold millions of copies, becoming one of the iconic images of the '70s.<\/p><p>Then, just as suddenly as her rise to fame, she made a stunning choice, deciding to leave the angels after just one season to focus on a movie career. Her popularity immediately went on the wane.<\/p><p>FAWCETT: We need him, Victor.<\/p><p>HAMMER: The next few years saw several forgettable movies like \"Logan's Run\" in 1976. She got better box office with \"Cannonball Run\" in 1981. The following year she and Lee Majors divorced.<\/p><p>But she proved that she could be a serious actress. In 1984's \"The Burning Bed.\" Fawcett took the role as a battered wife who kills her husband. A true story based on a landmark legal case. The role earned her an Emmy nomination. One of three in her career, though she never got to take home a statue.<\/p><p>She also became involved in the longest romantic relationship of her life. She dated Ryan O'Neal for 15 years before the relationship ended in 1997. And although they never married, they did have a son, Redmond O'Neal. Fawcett continued to turn heads well into middle age. She continued to get roles on TV and in the movies and shocked many by posing nude as she neared the age of 50. The magazine was one of \"Playboy's best sellers.<\/p><p>But as Fawcett approached her 60s, the spotlight turned away from Farrah the sex symbol to Farrah the celebrity battling cancer in 2006.<\/p><p>FAWCETT: The disease has spread. Suddenly there were nine tumors in my liver.<\/p><p>HAMMER: The documentary, \"Farrah's Story,\" which aired in May 2009, focused on Fawcett's battle to beat cancer and stay alive. Her courageous journey was cathartic in allowing Fawcett to finally tell her story in her own words to the world.<\/p><p>A.J. Hammer, CNN, New York.<\/p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)<\/p><p>HARRIS: And, again, the news just in to CNN, we've been able to confirm that actress Farrah Fawcett has passed away. She died at 9:28 this morning Pacific Time.<\/p><p>Elizabeth Cohen is with us now.<\/p><p>And, Elizabeth, you were mentioning just moments ago, and it's worth mentioning again, that this woman, in her fight against this cancer, was truly, in your view, an empowered patient.<\/p><p>COHEN: She was. She took her health into her own hands. She really did.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Yes.<\/p><p>COHEN: And that documentary I think speaks volumes to that.<\/p><p>The first thing she did was talk about anal cancer, which is important. There are 5,000 new cases of anal cancer diagnosed in this country every year. But people don't feel really comfortable talking about sort of that part of the body, but she was and she came out and she talked about her illness.<\/p><p>HARRIS: That's right. And I got to tell you, there are so many lasting images, as I look at these pictures of Farrah Fawcett, that are indelible in my mind. Her work as an actress, obviously. The terrific work in the film \"The Burning Bed,\" where she turned a spotlight on the whole issue of domestic violence and raised that to a national level debate in a way that it hadn't been before. Certainly in a new way. I think about the courage of that particular piece. And, my goodness, what about the iconic work on \"Charlie's Angels\"?<\/p><p>COHEN: Well, you know, when she was on \"Charlie's Angels,\" which when I was a kid, you might think, oh she's just a twitty blond . . .<\/p><p>HARRIS: Yes, yes, yes.<\/p><p>COHEN: You know, but she certainly didn't turn out that way.<\/p><p>HARRIS: No, no.<\/p><p>COHEN: I mean she really took her health care in to her own hands and made a difference in so many different issues.<\/p><p>HARRIS: All right. We are efforting any number of people who have been close to Farrah Fawcett in her life and certainly in these last few years when she has been fighting so mightily against this -- this cancer. We're going to continue to look at these tremendous images of her.<\/p><p>Tom O'Neal is on the phone with us. And, Tom, as you know, is the senior editor of \"In Touch Weekly.\"<\/p><p>Tom, good to talk to you. Thanks for getting on the line with us so quickly.<\/p><p>TOM O'NEAL, SENIOR EDITOR, \"IN TOUCH WEEKLY\": Sure.<\/p><p>HARRIS: First of all, your thoughts, and take your time here, your thoughts and your reflections on, first of all, the life of Farrah Fawcett. And then maybe you can talk about her iconic stature in American popular culture.<\/p><p>O'NEAL: This isn't just a loss of another movie star or TV star. Farrah was always our pal. She was from Texas. She had this charm and way about her that won you over when she was on the talk show circuit. You know, we went -- we followed her through this drama of her career and broken romantic relationships with Lee Majors and marriage, the ups and downs with Ryan O'neal. They never did get married, but they were together for 17 years and then, of course, got back together in recent years.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Yes.<\/p><p>O'NEAL: And she was always -- you always felt a kind of special kinship with her.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Tom, talk about -- we were just talking about -- Elizabeth Cohen and I were talking about the piece of work she did and the series, the television series, that maybe she will be most remembered for, and that's the work on the show \"Charlie's Angels.\" You know, as Elizabeth was saying, and I would second it, it would have been easy for a lot of folks to just dismiss her as being sort of the ditzy blonde. But she was even more than that in that role on that show.<\/p><p>O'NEAL: Yes. You're talking about the cancer special or the . . .<\/p><p>HARRIS: No, no, I'm talking about her work on \"Charlie's Angels.\"<\/p><p>O'NEAL: Well, think about how important \"Charlie's Angels\" was in the social context of the time. A TV show about the empowerment of women.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Yes.<\/p><p>O'NEAL: Now these were butt kickers. These were dynamic ladies, you know, coming out to take care of the bad guys. And then at the same time, she had this poster that was on every boy's bedroom wall in America.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Well, I didn't want to be -- Tom, I didn't want to be the first one to mention the poster, but I'm glad you did because, my goodness, a, what a poster. And I think you're absolutely right, that poster was everywhere. O'NEAL: And let's talk about what was extraordinary about that poster. Not just her beauty and this great tasseled mane of hair. The fact that she was not, shall we say, well endowed up on top and was flaunting that in this and was so sexy about it. And, again, think about what -- there's a consistent pattern in her career. \"Charlie's Angels,\" she was defiant and she was courageous in what she did. That poster was courageous in its way.<\/p><p>Then she did -- when she left \"Charlie's Angels,\" she did a movie called \"The Burning Bed\" on TV, which dealt with domestic violence and relationships. And then at the end of her life, she has the guts to do this painfully honest documentary about her battle with cancer that was one of the most powerful things I've ever seen. But I'm sure you were as shocked as I was when you watched it, you couldn't believe she was so generous sharing all of this intimate information about herself.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Well, Tom, yes, yes, Tom, let me be honest with you, I just I couldn't watch it. I saw some of the clips for it. And, boy, it was all the things you've described. And I just couldn't bring myself to watch it because it was so personal and so honest. It was just tough to watch. And so I didn't.<\/p><p>O'NEAL: Yes. Especially with somebody like Farrah, who -- who we think we got to know very well through the years. It's, in fact, watching a friend going through that.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Uh-huh. You mentioned \"The Burning Bed.\" I thought that was just a tremendous piece of work. And my comment about it just moments ago is that it really elevated the whole discussion on domestic violence in this country. Do you agree?<\/p><p>O'NEAL: Absolutely. It was -- it was so important at the time. And it was considered one of her greatest performances.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Right.<\/p><p>O'NEAL: And she always considered it that. She was Emmy nominated for the role as well, by the way. But the fact that Farrah, somebody that beautiful isn't supposed to have a terrible marriage and not supposed to be knocked around by her husband in that kind of role. So, you know, why is she putting up with it? There are wonderful psychological layers to the -- to her being cast in that role and why it worked so well.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Boy, Tom, tremendous. It's terrific to talk to you. And thank you for your remembrances of -- I think you're right, so much more than a movie star, but certainly a movie star, television star of the first order.<\/p><p>Tom O'Neal, senior editor, \"In Touch Weekly.\"<\/p><p>Tom, thank you.<\/p><p>We're back with more reflections on Farrah Fawcett, who passed away this morning, 9:28 Pacific Time. We're back in a moment. You're in the CNN NEWSROOM.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Well, OK, this developing story. We told you earlier in the newscast about a double Amber Alert out of North Carolina. Six-year- old Alexander Suddeath and his four-year-old sister, Heidi, went missing almost 24 hours ago in the Smoky Mountains. The children and their parents were beginning a family hike on the Appalachian Trail.<\/p><p>Well, guess what? Terrific news to report. The children have been found by rescuers. The children have been found. And they are absolutely OK.<\/p><p>A little more information here. Both were located about a mile from where they were last seen by their parents. And searchers are right now leading them back to a command post that had been set up. Let's see. Searchers located the kids after they found a shoe and that eventually led them to where the children were.<\/p><p>Both kids OK, found by rescuers and being led back to a command post. And soon we will have a happy reunion with the parents.<\/p><p>And once again, we are getting reaction, reflections on the life, the career of Farrah Fawcett. The actress passed away this morning, 9:28 Pacific Time. Farrah Fawcett dying after a long battle, a very public battle were anal cancer.<\/p><p>Let's get to Los Angeles now. Our Kara Finnstrom is there.<\/p><p>Kara, what are you hearing about the life, the passing of Farrah Fawcett?<\/p><p>KARA FINNSTROM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Tony, what we have been able to confirm with her publicist this morning is that she has died after that long, lengthy, courageous battle with anal cancer. She died, as you mentioned, at 9:28 this morning at a hospital here in the Los Angeles area.<\/p><p>We do expect to get a statement from her representative a little later on this morning. But she was an iconic '70s star. Best known, of course, for her role in \"Charlie's Angels.\" But she was only on that show for about a year before she broke her contract and went on to make a number of movies. She often said that her favorite project that she worked on was \"The Burning Bed.\" She felt that that best showcased her work.<\/p><p>In recent days, she was known very well for a documentary that she had put out. She actually taped herself, showing very intimate, private details with her battle with anal cancer. And amongst people in the cancer community, that had really made her a very popular person. They had really associated with her, her battle and were really following her very closely.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Well, Kara, I know this is probably too early to have these kinds of details, but I'll ask the question anyway. 9:28 Pacific Time she passed away. Do we have any idea who was -- where this happened? Was it in her home, in the hospital? And who was by her side?<\/p><p>FINNSTROM: We don't have those details. We do know in recent days she had a vigil at her bedside with her son and with her longtime companion, Ryan O'Neal. But we don't have those specific details.<\/p><p>HARRIS: OK. Kara Finnstrom for us in Los Angeles.<\/p><p>Kara, appreciate it. Thank you.<\/p><p>We are pushing forward now with the next hour of CNN NEWSROOM with Kyra Phillips.<\/p><\/body>","538":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">The following information was released by the U.S. Department of State:<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">MODERATOR: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Washington Foreign Press Center. Today, we are pleased to have with us Roberta Jacobson, the Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs. On June 26th through the 29th, she traveled to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. She met with leaders with from all sectors of Central American society to advance our regional partnership for a more secure and prosperous Central America. She will discuss the accomplishments of this trip and review the goals of the Western Hemisphere agenda, and it will then be opened for questions and answers. Thank you.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: All right. Thank you, Jean, and good afternoon. Its nice to see everybody again. I am relatively recently back from Central America, and I wanted to start off talking a little bit about that, about the trip, and about some of the things I saw and put it in a little bit of context, and then we can open it up to whatever everyone would like to talk about.<\/p><p>So let me start off saying that it had been about a year and a half since I had been to Central America, and so it seemed like a good idea to get back there. Obviously, this is a big focus for us, especially in our security programs, and the Central American Regional Security Program is obviously an integral part of all four of our interlocking security citizen security initiatives: the Merida Initiative in Mexico, Central American Regional Security Initiative, the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, and the Colombia Strategic Development Initiative. So it was important for me to get back to talking with some of our Central American partners.<\/p><p>I think overall one of the things that you see in Central America, which is a hallmark of what were doing around the hemisphere, really is the two areas in particular, one, that the engagement on security issues goes well beyond law enforcement and just the police or military side of security. When we talk about working with partners in the hemisphere on citizen security issues, were talking about an integrated approach to citizen security that spans the gamut, and Im going to talk about that again in a minute.<\/p><p>But the other thing I wanted to mention was it was very important to me that I highlight something that the Secretary has talked about a great deal, Secretary Clinton, which is the importance of civil society. One of the things the Secretary has said she said it at the Summit of the Americas in talking with the civil society forum, but she has repeated it since is that for us our foreign policy really does have three legs in this stool. And those legs are government and we obviously undertake a lot of government-to-government interaction the private sector and the business community, and civil society writ large. And I felt that I had had a pretty good opportunity over the last year or so to interact with governmental counterparts, and obviously I was going to do some of that on this trip, but that it was most important for me to make sure that I touch base with civil society activists because that is the sense that you cant really get in Washington. That is the value added of traveling. So that was an emphasis of the trip.<\/p><p>Since 2008, I think most of you know, the Central American Regional Security Initiative we have appropriated and disbursed close to $500 million of assistance in Central America, with the considerable amount of our focus on the three northern triangle countries: El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, which were the three that I visited. Those span the range of this integrated approach, as I mentioned, which really does run from police and security, law enforcement activity, to prosecutors, judges, public defenders, working with judicial systems, alternative dispute resolution, and onto efforts that were making in communities to strengthen communities to withstand the impact of transnational crime. And thats why over 90 percent of our assistance, bilateral assistance in Central America, is focused on core development issues health, education, issues like support for civil society and economic growth.<\/p><p>So I traveled to the three countries in that order, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. And two of the things that I think were most exciting for me were events that I was able to hold focusing on education and youth. In El Salvador, I was privileged to hand out 49 micro scholarships as part of our SEMILLA or SEED program. This has been in effect for many years, but weve amplified it more recently. The recipients were 50 percent female and all students that came from rural areas, students who might otherwise never have had an opportunity to go to the United States and study. And what was just as exciting as meeting the students who are going to study education, healthcare, small business development what was just as exciting was meeting their families, people who had traveled pretty long distances to be there for this celebration of their childrens success, and I thought that was terrific. We also had the privilege of having one of the alumni of the program with us who is a two-term mayor in La Union, of a community in La Union, and former governor, who was a participant in this SEED program when he was in high school. They will be studying at community colleges across the United States.<\/p><p>In Guatemala, I had the opportunity to go to Coban and to visit with students in our Access English program. What some folks may not know is that the Access English program in Guatemala is the largest in the hemisphere with 1,400 students, over 700 alumni, which is a little bit surprising, I think, to many people. But these kids were just remarkable. They are incredible students of English. They were very proud of what they had done. A number of the advanced students were serving as translators and interpreters for a U.S.-Guatemalan military humanitarian exercise that was underway called Beyond the Horizon, which I also visited. And they are serving with the medics, translating not from Spanish to English but from Kiche to English. And so they were just performing these invaluable services as a result of being able to take these classes in English for a number of months. And they were just remarkable and very enthusiastic about their work. So those were two of the things that I did.<\/p><p>In Guatemala, El Salvador, and in Honduras I also met with groups of civil society, human rights, nongovernmental organizations, those working in labor, working on legal reforms. And the group that I met with that was the largest was in El Salvador, but in Guatemala and Honduras I also got a very good representation of civil society. In Honduras, that included meeting with leaders of the Alliance for Peace and Justice, which is about a three-month-old civil society consortium, which I was very impressed with, impressed with their work and impressed with their enthusiasm, including Julieta Castellanos, the rector of the University in Honduras whose son was tragically killed last year.<\/p><p>In all three places, I think one of the things that left me optimistic was the fact that there were such vibrant civil society organizations engaged, doing their own work, working in communities, gathering their own statistics, challenging the government on occasion, but also working with them to try and create safer communities.<\/p><p>The other thing that impressed me was we know from statistics that communities in which we work with municipal governments, especially USAIDs programs on prevention and on economic opportunity, those communities have seen marked decreases in crime. But one of the things that impressed me the most in El Salvador was so have communities in which we are not necessarily working, but community leaders themselves are working to organize some of those same efforts. And so it really underscored the belief that you cannot fight crime without the engagement and involvement of the community and without creating some opportunities, especially for young people.<\/p><p>The other things, I had meetings in all three countries, obviously, with government leaders. In Honduras, there was a SICA meeting that was taking place, and that was the reason part of the reason that I was there. It was very exciting for me to be there for the first time as a formal observer to SICA, since the U.S. and I signed those papers a couple of months ago. The SICA meeting, as you may know, had a little bit of turbulence in one of the agreements that was being signed within SICA with Panama, but it really went very well in the end. We were able to make the statement about the importance of regional efforts and that no country can do this alone. Our programs are premised on regional cooperation to combat transnational crime.<\/p><p>But the other thing I thought was very exciting was that the SICA countries were able to sign the agreement with the EU, which was there to do so, which reinforces, I think, those of us who were members of the Friends of Central America group, remaining engaged and working together to coordinate our assistance in that part of the world.<\/p><p>So I left Central America, I think, frankly, slightly more optimistic than Ive been in a while. I think this is a very long, hard slog that is going to take quite a while, because fundamentally, the efforts against transnational crime can only be combated by stronger democratic institutions, institutions like the police and military, institutions like the judiciary, institutions like the fiscales (ph), institutions in communities. And so that is a long-term project and not one that were going to see turn around immediately. But I think people are starting to know what works and starting to replicate it, and I also think weve seen very important movement forward over the last year or two by governments to create the structures and the legal frameworks, the policy agenda that makes success possible, which is certainly a very important first step. There is still a ways to go.<\/p><p>But I also came back very encouraged by what were doing with young people. The best part of my job and I said this while I was there the best part of my job is the engagement with young people on educational issues, because that it sounds like sort of kumbaya and clich, but that actually is the way we ensure that things get better in the future. So I was very encouraged by that.<\/p><p>And I will leave you finally with a reiteration of the importance of institutions. I was listening to Fernando Henrique Cardoso over the last two days and last night when he won the Kluge Prize at the Library of Congress, which is a $1 million prize for his academic study of humanity. And he talked about a phrase that we have seen elsewhere, but I really like it in this context, which is the infrastructure of hope. And in the end, the infrastructure of hope, what it means is democratic institutions that can withstand corruption, that can withstand transnational crime, that can withstand abuse, and thats what were trying to construct with our partners in Central America. So let me stop there and open things up.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. So first question, well go right here. Just wait for the microphone and state your name and<\/p><p>QUESTION: Jesus Esquivel from Proceso Magazine. Roberta, I have two questions for you one on Central America and the other on Mexico. The President-elect of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, has said hes going to change the strategy in the war on drugs, especially with the relation of the United States. He wants to demilitarize the strategy, and second, he says hes going to concentrate more on the issue of security for the Mexican people. And he says the measure of success is not on the number of confiscation of drugs and the arrest of the capos in Mexico.<\/p><p>My question to in this regard is: Is the U.S. Government worried about it? You know very well the issue of narcotics in Mexico, and that will probably increase the number of drugs crossing the border if hes going to do exactly what hes saying. Are you guys worried about it? I know youre going to say, We are ready to work with him, but the State Department already said that.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Youre answering your own question, Jesus. (Laughter.)<\/p><p>QUESTION: Well, but Roberta, we need more<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Its a fair question.<\/p><p>QUESTION: We need more specific answer to that. And the second is on Central America. He also said that one of his priorities will be working with Central America and trying to include Brazil on that. And he says the Merida Initiative is not working as it was planned on Central America. So he says he want to have more hemisphere approach to the problem of the security and international crime in Central America. Whats your position on that?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Okay. Thanks. I appreciate that, and let me start with the first question. Im not going to surprise you. Im not worried. And part of the reason Im not worried is because I think weve certainly watched and listened to everything that Enrique Pena Nieto has said before the election and now since the election, and youre right, Im going to say that we look forward to working with him, which we do.<\/p><p>But its also true that I have seen nothing in anything he has said that gives me cause for concern. The notion that somebody wants to re-look at a strategy and possibly make changes I think is not only to be expected but a healthy thing. Strategies get put into place to respond to a moment in time and hopefully move you forward, right, in the fight against transnational organized crime. But they also have to be adaptable. They have to shift and change, because we know that the criminal organizations shift and change.<\/p><p>We also know, and I would say much more broadly, that the notion that you want to go from whats your measure of success is it drugs interdicted, is it rates of homicide or violence I have always said, and I think we have said from the beginning with the Merida Initiative, that there are many multiple metrics that you can use and that clearly the level of violence in Mexico is unacceptable to Mexicans and it should be unacceptable to all of us. And so the fact that that is an important metric for the President-elect, I think is entirely logical. I dont think it necessarily means there will be less drugs interdicted. I dont know exactly what changes to the strategy the new President may make and what those changes what effect those changes will have on the cartels. I think well have to wait and see. But its a very productive conversation to have. And it is clearly one of the things you hear from all over the region, is that the level of violence is too high, that that has to go down. Its why we have seen changes in the way that people approach this problem. Its why you see changes like the truce that was brokered in El Salvador with the gangs. There is a real desire to lower that level of violence that is entirely understandable.<\/p><p>But I would also say that when you talk about Central America and where Mexico may shift or emphasize engagement with Central America, I think thats incredibly encouraging. I think thats exactly the right message, which is that we all have to be working better together, that Mexico has an enormous amount to contribute even while it is confronting these problems at home, but that there are others in the hemisphere who have something that they can bring to the table to support efforts in Central America. Weve seen that already, quite frankly, very actively and very positively with Colombia, in Central America, and with Chile, already engaging with those countries on ways of doing business and ways of combating corruption and criminal activity that have been successful and can be modeled or replicated or adjusted for Central America.<\/p><p>The notion of whether Brazil can also play a role on that, I think is a very positive conversation to have. I think certainly the Brazilians have capabilities and have experience that can be useful, and we think the more partners from within the hemisphere that can help in Central America, the better.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. For our next question, well go in the front here to Sonia.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi. Thank you. My name is Sonia Schott. I am with Globovision, Venezuela. Heavyweight Republicans have criticized the politics towards the political strategy towards Venezuela. I was wondering if you have any comments on that, if you agreed on that, because it seems to be that the bilateral relations are in a freeze point. It is because the electoral year, not only here but in Venezuela, and that makes me go to my second question. You have repeatedly asked for a transparent process, electoral process in Venezuela. What did that mean? What will need to happen in Venezuela in order for you to recognize it was a transparent electoral process? Does it has to do with the electoral missions? Thank you.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thank you. I appreciate that. I think it probably will not surprise you that I disagree with the notion that we do not have a good policy on Venezuela. I think the thing about our policy on Venezuela is and I would argue that, yes, we are both in electoral years; yes, electoral years in every country in the world make international relations more complicated because domestic politics takes precedence in many ways. But I would argue to you that the relationship that we have with Venezuela, if indeed its frozen and I dont disagree that it is not as productive as it could be right now but that that started before certainly before our electoral calendar really picked up, and it was independent of that. And frankly, it is disappointing to us because we are willing to and happy to engage on practical issues where we can cooperate or we may see things the same way. But we have not had that reciprocated from the Venezuelan Government, and thats unfortunate.<\/p><p>We also obviously would like to be able to cooperate on issues of regional importance, but that has not been possible because the Venezuelan Government has not seemed eager to do that, to work with us, as opposed to speaking, in the rhetorical sense certainly, against some of the United States initiatives and some of our efforts. So that is disappointing to us. And we remain ready to have that more productive relationship, but not willing to do anything more than extend that hand. And if it is not reciprocated, then we arent willing to take that any further. Its just not productive.<\/p><p>Let me also say, though, that on the elections, I think there are very clear ways in which Venezuela can ensure that the international community at large not just the United States, which frankly is not necessarily the arbiter here, it is the international community at large can have confidence in the results. And the way to do that is to welcome in observers. And so we hope that that will be the case, that Venezuela will welcome in observers, whether from the EU or the OAS. I think that would make a very large difference in the confidence that those in the international community have in the results.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. For our next question, well go to New York.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Yes. Hello. I am Ana Baron from Clarin of Argentina. Thank you very much for this press conference. I have two questions on Argentina. First of all, while we know that trade restrictions was one of the subjects you discussed on your last trip to Argentina, so I wanted to know since then there was the United States complaint in the WTO. Now Argentina, some time ago some minutes ago, hours ago has presented a complaint against the lemons and meat restrictions in U.S. market. So I wanted to know if we are assisting to a little trade war between the two countries.<\/p><p>And second, I have a question of narco-trafficking. You were talking a lot about narco-trafficking in Central America. Since the plane the military plane was detained in Ezeiza, it seems that the cooperation between the two countries has diminished significantly. I wanted to know if this is a subject that worries and if you see some prospective of ameliorating the relationship at this on this subject.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thank you. I think on the first point, on the trade issues, it certainly wasnt the central part central component of my visit there. Im not a trade expert for the U.S. Government. But I certainly did have conversations, and we continue, obviously, as you note, in these movements more recently to continue to have conversations with Argentina about concerns that we have, whether on specific trade issues or on import restrictions and other things that U.S. companies are finding difficult in Argentina. We continue again to look for a way that we can cooperate on these issues, but we do think that there are international rules and regulations that we all have to abide by. And its one of the reasons why the WTO is there, why organizations like ICSID or SIAVE (ph)*, the organization to arbitrate financial disputes. What we believe in is a rules-based system in which folks actually comply with the rules, which we will do when the decisions go against us and we hope other countries will do when decisions go against them.<\/p><p>So were still trying to work through all of these issues, but I will say that there is a desire on both parties sides, I think certainly speaking for the United States Government to try and resolve those issues in as productive a way as we can, and to try and recognize that we have lots of other components of a bilateral relationship that can move ahead. And we want to be sure that while we work on those economic, commercial, or trade problems that we may have in the relationship, they do not, frankly, bleed into other areas of the relationship where we have a more positive engagement and we are able to move forward.<\/p><p>When I was in Argentina in February, two of the things that I worked on and that I think that Im particularly excited about are moving forward on educational exchanges, which, frankly, are pretty low between Argentina and the United States. I think theres head room there, room to grow.<\/p><p>And so weve moved forward with an agreement with the Argentine Government on some additional scholarships and pushing up those numbers. And I had a meeting with 13 rectors of universities that was very productive, as well as with the Minister of Education. But we also signed a sister parks agreement for our national parks, which I think is also very important, and was very impressed by the Argentine presentation on that.<\/p><p>In following up on that, we now have we had the NASA administrator who went to Argentina. And we have Tecnopolis, I think opening this week perhaps in Argentina, with an exhibit from the United States. So theres lots of other areas in which we can cooperate.<\/p><p>Getting to your second question because I think it relates, obviously cooperating on narcotics is one of those areas where I think that we should still be able to work together regardless of other problems. And its also true that cooperation on security issues, in particular narcotics\/counternarcotics efforts, was clearly set back by the incident last year. I am pretty optimistic that were going to be able to move ahead on a cooperative agenda on narcotics issues. I think there is a desire on the part of the Argentine Government to move ahead on that, and I certainly will confirm that there is a strong desire on our part.<\/p><p>So Im more optimistic probably even than I was when I was in Argentina four or five months ago that we can move ahead on that productively.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Great. For our next question well go in the front right here.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Jacobson. This is Tomas Guevara, the editor of El Diario de Hoy, Salvador. When you visited recently El Salvador, the countrys in a serious political crisis now. What do you think about that situation between the conflict with the national assembly, with the supreme court, and how it can impact the relationship with the U.S.?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I think its an incredibly important question, and I was struck obviously by that dispute between the assembly and the court when I was in El Salvador. And I obviously spoke with a lot of people about it to learn as much as I could, to hear from folks on the ground what they saw as the prospects for resolution. And this was I was there just before July 1. Now weve passed that July 1 date, and so in some respects the issue has gotten even more acute.<\/p><p>And I would say this does concern us very greatly. This is clearly something that Salvadorans have to resolve, that we have said clearly, both I have said it in El Salvador but our Ambassador and we were all thrilled to have Mari Carmen Aponte back in San Salvador as our Ambassador has said publicly that we really do urge in the strongest terms possible that the two sides of this dispute really try and come together and resolve it. And I think thats important. It is a Salvadoran dispute to resolve; it is not ours to opine on how it gets resolved. We would just like to see it resolved.<\/p><p>But I will say that there are some issues that are important to us that engage the court or the national assembly, and those things are being, frankly, held up by this dispute. The question of extraditions, which there are a number of extraditions pending, and we think its important that extraditions be part of not the only available tool but part of the tool kit that governments be able to use to fight transnational crime. Those may not move ahead while this dispute simmers.<\/p><p>There is discussion in El Salvador, I certainly heard from all sides, of new investment laws and things that need to move ahead in the national assembly, which would be very important and very, I think, beneficial for the Partnership for Growth effort that were undertaking with El Salvador and the efforts that were trying to make to move ahead on economic development. If those things get slowed down by this dispute, then thats a problem that really affects more than just El Salvador, unfortunately.<\/p><p>QUESTION: A follow-up?<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Sure. A follow-up.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi. This is Luis Alonso. Are you concerned with the stability of the President Funes Government? Because of this dispute, is there a state of rule of law in danger by this dispute?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I confess to you, I have seen lots of breathless commentary about this. And theres no doubt in my mind that this is a serious concern and a serious problem that needs to be worked out, but I have absolutely no concerns about the stability of the Funes Government and its sort of democracy surviving in El Salvador. This is a dispute between two branches of government. I have every confidence that Salvadorans from the various branches of government will resolve this is an amicable and legal and constitutional way, and that overall the democratic health of El Salvador will not suffer for it.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. The next question well go here and then to Denise after.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Santiago Tavara from Notimex. Do you have any update on the in Honduras the recent incidents, two incidents that involved DEA agents? And about the first incident, I think Spokesperson Victoria Nuland told us that she would release a report in the next weeks. I dont know if you have a date. And also, the second question is on Peru regarding human rights abuses reported against people who are protesting against gold mine<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Conga.<\/p><p>QUESTION: -- a proposed mine in Peru from the U.S.-based Newmont Mining Corporation. I dont know if you have any reaction.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Well, let me start on Honduras. Obviously, weve been in engaged with in support of the Honduran Government in operations against narcotics trafficking in northern Honduras, coastal Honduras, in the last number of months. In those operations, over two and a half tons of cocaine was seized in two-plus just over two months, which is an extraordinary record. I want to say clearly from the outset that in the first incident and Im not sure which first or second were talking about, but May 11th, in which it would appear from the reports that weve seen certainly from the preliminary reports that four people were killed. And that is never what you want to happen, and we regret that greatly. That was an incident in which it was not the DEA but Hondurans who were firing guns and fired upon.<\/p><p>But in all of these incidents, I think we have to wait until the investigations and the reviews are concluded. What we will do as things proceed is we will obviously be reviewing with our Honduran counterparts exactly what the operations how they worked, what worked well, what didnt work well, how can we avoid, obviously, any deaths in the future.<\/p><p>And I will also say that in the second two incidents, which were ones in which DEA did unfortunately the DEA agents did unfortunately kill those who were trafficking drugs, we do expect, frankly, that those actually doing the trafficking will resist losing their cargo and being arrested. And unfortunately, it is a very dangerous game. What we want to try and ensure with our Honduran partners is that nobody who is not involved in narco-trafficking is wounded or killed as a consequence of these operations.<\/p><p>But I think that it does reinforce the importance of that area physically, geographically, in terms of the root of cocaine up north towards the United States. And we have seen lots of indications polls taken in Honduras of support for our continued engagement, and the government has made clear that they would like the United States to remain engaged in that support and training role.<\/p><p>The second question was on Peru and reports of human rights abuses to those protesting. Its the Conga Mine, I assume. And to be honest with you, Ive seen some of the press reports, but I dont have any independent information on that. Obviously, its always worrisome when you have a situation in which there is violence, in which protest is not carried out peacefully. And what we would like to see and obviously in support of the Peruvian Government, its not a role for us is a resolution to the very difficult situation that has emerged between the community and the mining company. And I think the Peruvian Government is trying to resolve that as best they can.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Im Denise Chrispim Marim from O Estado de Sao Paolo, Brazil. Thank you very much for this opportunity. We were waiting for a long time for this.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Im sorry. (Laughter.)<\/p><p>QUESTION: Well, I wonder (inaudible) and I wanted to ask you what is exactly the position of United States in the case of the crisis in Paraguay, particularly if you how is your assessment on the sanctions that has already been imposed against Paraguay by regional organizations? And how could be the best approach of OAS in this case?<\/p><p>Secondly, if you dont mind<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: That was all the first? Wasnt that like three parts?<\/p><p>QUESTION: No, it is you know that there is a lot of talks and speculations on a meeting between military American militarys and Paraguayan officials in Asuncion last days. And there is some speculations on the interest of America to build a military base in Paraguay. I wonder to know if you are aware about this information and if it is really a desire of United States.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Okay, let me start out with that second part, because I want to be very, very clear about this. I have no information about U.S. military meeting with Paraguayan counterparts or officials in recent days. So Im not sure what thats referring to.<\/p><p>We have no desire no desire, let me be clear about this to do anything in Paraguay that isnt either requested by the Paraguayan Government or an event, an occasion, a training, an engagement that is a partnership with Paraguay. And we have no interest in promoting a base or military presence in Paraguay separate or apart from sort of our normal interaction with the Paraguayans on counternarcotics issues, on training issues, on counterterrorism. We have engaged in that kind of cooperation very transparently for years, and we hope to continue to do that. That is very different than this notion of building bases, which I really want to dispel, because it does keep coming up, which I find somewhat bizarre.<\/p><p>The other thing I want to be clear about is that we are not only transparent about what our interests and our opportunities or engagement is with the Paraguayans to the public, to our own officials, to the Congress, but to anybody else in the region whos interested. And obviously weve had conversations with our Brazilian counterparts on what each of us are doing cooperatively with Paraguay, and so that there will never be surprises in that area.<\/p><p>On the crisis in Paraguay, I think one of the things that I think is important is the report of the OAS was presented to the Permanent Council yesterday, I guess, and we were obviously very pleased to be part of that mission. The mission was made up of the U.S., Mexican, Canadian, Haitian, and Honduran ambassadors to the OAS plus the Secretary General and I think one or two of his staff. I think that that mission really got a huge spectrum of opinions while they were there all of the branches of government, President Lugo and members of his cabinet, and so meeting with President Franco and folks from his cabinet and other organizations. So I think that was a very, very important step for the OAS to take because I do think that there were conversations that needed to take place about why things happened the way they did and what justification there was for things that hadnt really taken place. So I think that that was a very important first step, and we strongly support the Secretary General in that mission. That was certainly clear by our sending our ambassador. And we continue to support his efforts and think the report is really quite well done.<\/p><p>As we look forward because I think that what we really want to do is focus on the future and what assistance Paraguay may ask for and need from the OAS in terms of preparations for elections, dialogue on issues that are still of concern and creating tension, moving ahead to ensure that in this transition period, Paraguay gets ready for exemplary elections in April of 2013. And I think in that respect, we have an enormous amount in common with all of our regional partners who I think also want to look ahead and cooperate in helping Paraguay get to that point.<\/p><p>In terms of what sub-regional organizations may have done, sanctions or suspensions, I think thats for them to comment on. Weve been very comfortable with where the OAS is on this, and we think its an excellent forum for continued engagement.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Follow-up? (Laughter.)<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Well go to the follow-up and then to your question or is it a follow-up as well?<\/p><p>QUESTION: No, its a follow-up, but about another issue. So we can follow up this one.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. (Laughter.) So you pick.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Rock, paper, scissor.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi. Yes. Youve said that the report by the Secretary General of the OAS was quite well done. I wanted to know what your assessment is, what your opinion is, on his concrete proposals to send a mission to Paraguay until the elections, and also if you think that, as he said, that its not a constructive step to suspend Paraguay from the organization.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Name your media organization?<\/p><p>QUESTION: Its EFE.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I will give you the short answer to that as yes on both questions. The only thing I would add is I think the report is very well done. I think the notion of sending a mission, sending technical experts and that could change. It depends on what Paraguayans feel they need or what the skills are that is needed at the time. And as you get closer to election, different kinds of skills are needed. But I think the notion of having the OAS remain engaged with a mission in Paraguay is a very good one, a very positive one that I think would be helpful I believe and I hope for Paraguay and for all of the rest of us trying to sort of grapple with the issue. And I think that hes right, that at this point there really doesnt appear to be a reason to suspend Paraguay from the OAS.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: So now to your follow-up question.<\/p><p>QUESTION: So thank you for doing this. I am Silvia Pisani from La Nacion in Argentina. Also, so first, I would like to ask you a very specific follow-up in the first question about Argentina, and then I will jump into another line. But the follow up is: Also, I saw some concern in the United States about a specific point of the currency exchange policy in Argentina, regarding the possibility of buying dollars. And this was affecting the American enterprises to their imports because they cant buy the dollars that they need to import.<\/p><p>And also, its beginning to now, its beginning to generate some fear in the population of the possibility of traveling abroad. So I would like to ask you if you still have those concerns and if you specifically raised them to the Argentinean Government, and if that is the case, if you received any answer about that. Thats the first point.<\/p><p>And jumping in another line, I would like to ask you: I have been seeing in the Congress particularly some concern about the freedom of expression and the freedom of press in Argentina. I would like to ask your opinion about that. Thank you.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Okay. Thank you. What I can tell you in terms of the currency issue or the ability of, in particular, U.S. businesses to operate and be able to get currency out of the country, for example, which is one of the things I heard a great deal about when I was in Argentina in February, one of the difficulties that some of our companies are having is that for many of them, it may not be that difficult because theyre not they dont operate with huge amounts of cash. For certain sectors and I think you can probably figure out which ones; it may be airlines, it may be others but for certain sectors who get a lot of revenue in cash, if you will, they have difficulties. And some of these restrictions were making things difficult for them. And so what we had asked at the time was that the Government of Argentina look at the impact of some of these restrictions, which are very broad, on particular sectors which maybe have more acute difficulty with them. And so thats a continuing discussion that were having with the Argentine Government.<\/p><p>On freedom of expression, I guess I should say: We have talked a lot about this over the last year or so. Weve talked about our concerns for journalists in the hemisphere all of you, every day, know this for your brothers and sisters working in countries throughout the hemisphere, we see with a great deal of, I think the word is just sadness and anguish, when international organizations put out statements about this region being the most dangerous for journalists. I mean, that is really sometimes shocking to us. And that danger, obviously, has come from different quarters. And its come ferociously from organized crime, frankly. But there have been other threats to journalists work not to their lives, let me be clear, but to their work and to the freedom of expression that has been mounted by governments. Whether its lawsuits, whether it is withdrawal of revenue or advertisement, whether it is shutting things down, there are threats that confront journalists. And that it seems to us really critically important as part of democracy in the hemisphere. A free press is not optional. Its an integral part of democracy in the hemisphere.<\/p><p>Now, I think you would probably agree that in Argentina we certainly could not say that there is not an opposing view in the press to that of the government. There is certainly a healthy, open, exchange in the press. But I do think its important that we continue to press to ensure that governments understand that you really dont want to start down the slippery slope of trying to reduce the amount of freedom and ability to get their message out, the news out, the information out, because it can be a slippery slope, and thats very, very frightening for all of us.<\/p><p>I should say that I think there are lots of new ways of getting information, and so when people talk about press freedom and media ownership in the hemisphere as being too concentrated or its only one view of the situation in a particular country, it seems to us that the answer to that is essentially further democratization of media and press, which becomes easier in our digital and social media age, not a narrowing of that voice.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. Well go to Jose and then in the front here.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. Thank you for doing this really. Jose Diaz-Briseno with Reforma from Mexico. When talking about the understandable, well, a concern in Mexico to lower the violence, specifically the homicide rate, you mentioned the truce of murders in El Salvador. Do you think thats a model that could be feasible and desirable in Mexico between the cartels?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I think that every case is different. And I think that truces have to be seen and this is what I have certainly heard from experts on this subject, and I am not one of them. I will preface with that. But I have certainly heard from experts on this that the one thing you have to be sure of is that truces ceasefires, as theyre often called in the United States; ceasefire Chicago, Boston has tried some of these theyre never a permanent answer, right? So they are at best, even where they work and they dont always work they are at best a temporary measure while you put into place more structural and institutional changes to reduce either violence or drug trafficking or homicide or whatever or gang activity.<\/p><p>And so I think one of the things that we need to be a little bit careful of is the notion that a truce is what we all continue to look for, sort of the magic bullet, the single thing you can do that will solve this problem. And I think some of this the structure of organized crime and narcotics trafficking I think is significantly different than gang activity. And so I think both the multiplicity of players and the trade that theyre in make it much more complicated and much less likely that is a productive tool in that particular setting. But I think thats something that obviously people look at all the time, both academics and practitioners.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi, again. Just to going back to Paraguay, just want to make sure that the assessment on whether or not the impeachment of President Lugo is a coup detat has been finished. Have you guys reached a conclusion, like the OAS expressed yesterday, or youre still assessing the --<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Well, I think what I would say is that the OAS and what the Secretary General set out in his report makes a lot of sense to us. The Secretary General talked about concerns over the rapidity or the speed of the process. We have expressed those concerns publicly. But he also talked about the constitution in Paraguay and what it provides for. And so he is striking that balance between a process that may have seemed too rapid but also is set out in their constitution. And so I think the most important thing we support his report, and the most important thing at this point is to look for constructive ways moving forward to engage with the Paraguayans, including with the Franco government, to get to the elections next year.<\/p><p>QUESTION: So it was not a coup detat?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Im not going to answer that question, Luis.<\/p><p>QUESTION: (Inaudible.)<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thats the implication of what I said, that may be.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. Silvia Ayuso from the German Press Agency. My question is related to Cuba. There are increasing reports, rumors, nothing yet still confirmed about a possible outbreak of cholera even that might have reached even Havana. I was wondering if you have some information, and would that be the case? Would that affect some kind of I mean, the travels to the island what could be done in this respect from the U.S.?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Let me just say that its my understanding actually that Cuba has made a statement that there is cholera but that its under control in eastern part of Cuba. And so at this point, frankly, what we know is what weve seen as the press, as all of you have. I will say that obviously if there has been an outbreak of cholera, whether its under control or not, these this is the kind of information that we often put into I dont know that we will, but we often put into our Consular Information Sheets or Travel Warnings where they exist to make sure that Americans know about that possibility. But I dont know that thats been done yet or will need to be done. Well have to see how this develops.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Next question here, and then to you.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you very much. Im Lina Correa from Voice of America, also in Cuba. A few weeks ago the State Department asked for a humanitarian act in the case of Alan Gross. Have you received any answer from the Cuban Government about that? And also, how can the public opinion in United States value that U.S. policy with regard to Cuba when we cannot see any sign of change there?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Well, I think on the first question, on Alan Gross, youre quite right. We have actually repeatedly made a request of the Cuban Government to release Alan Gross on a humanitarian basis to be home with his family, to see his 90-year-old mother whos dying of cancer, and to attend to his own health issues. And no, we have not gotten an acceptable response at this point. And obviously he is not home with his family, so that has not occurred. Despite the fact that Mr. Gonzalez was permitted by the court to see his brother, who was ill, we have not gotten that kind of action from the Cuban Government on Mr. Grosss case.<\/p><p>On the issue of change in Cuba, I think one of the things that is always hard to judge is it is difficult for us sometimes to understand, where there may be change, how much change there may be. We obviously cant venture very far outside Havana very often, and that makes it difficult for us to know what may be happening in other parts of the country. There are a lot of economic changes that have been announced, that have been talked about, that have been rumored, but not as much thats actually been implemented and thats being seen, I think, on the ground and in peoples lives.<\/p><p>But I think its interesting, when you see Raul Castro going to VietnamVietnam, which is a country which has made significant changes and with which we obviously want to see even further changes on the political side, but economic changes have already been made there is no doubt, it seems to me, that there is continued discussion and studying and interest in changes in Cuba.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, we have not seen any conversation from the governments side of political changes. Lots of conversation about economic changes that may or may not make a huge difference in peoples lives, but no changes in the ability of people to express themselves freely, to organize into political parties, et cetera. And that I mean, that does not change our policy, nor do I think it denigrates it any way. But what it does mean, I think, is that continuing the people-to-people contact that we have had, the changes that this President made to the regulations both on travel and on remittances with Cuba, are important ones to try and engage with the Cuban people in the absence of our ability to engage and see change in the Cuban Government.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: We have time for one or two more questions. Well start here.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thanks. Martha Avila from RCN TV, Colombia. Whats your opinion about the security in Colombia today? In the last days, the FARC has increased the terrorist attacks in the country. How see the U.S. Government the situation? The security in Colombia is worse?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I dont think that thats a conclusion that I would draw yet at this point, and I certainly hope its one that I wont be drawing. We certainly have seen those attacks and we are concerned about them, and we obviously deplore the violence. I want to actually make just a side comment because I failed to mention it when Jose and I were talking. I want to also reject the violence against El Norte in Monterrey, against a newspaper there.<\/p><p>But in the case of the FARC in Colombia, I think that its very clear that that is not the way forward, that the government will handle these issues and handle them well. We have confidence in the Government of Colombia. But I dont think that anyone can yet draw a conclusion that security is worse in Colombia. And I certainly hope that will not be the case and that the FARC will not return to acts of violence such as they committed in the past, which obviously we deplored and continue to. And thats not the way ahead in Colombia.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi. Im Luciana Coelho, Folha de Sao Paulo, Brazil. Just to bring back to the OAS a little bit, there are some concern from a group of NGOs and even within the OAS that there are a group of countries organized to kind of, Id say, deflate the system and the OAS and its importance. And Brazil is in its group, and also Ecuador and others. So the situation in Paraguay and the divisions within the member countries since supposed risk of exacerbation of this movement. Id like to know if the U.S. is paying any attention to that, if there is any concern, and if you see that this could harm the inter-American system.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thank you for the question. I actually I think many of you may have seen some of the comments that I made, that our delegation made, and some of the things that were said at the OAS General Assembly in Cochabamba. In particular, the OAS the inter-American system on human rights came under just fierce attack, I mean just the fiercest Ive ever seen. And that is something that worries us enormously.<\/p><p>The heart in some respects, the heart of the Organization of American States and the thing that, in my opinion, it should be most proud of is the inter-American system on human rights the commission, the court, all of the processes that have been developed over the years. You may take issue with individual decisions. The United States is brought before the commission more than any other country in the hemisphere, and we very often dont agree with the decisions. But we will defend the commission and its right to act forever, because the system is not designed for a particular case. It is not designed for a particular government. Its designed to protect the constellation of rights and democratic freedoms that we have all agreed to against any kind of incursion. And sometimes those decisions are difficult for countries. But the discomfort is the price we pay for a system that defends all of us at various times and has defended very important issues of human rights in the last 40 years in this hemisphere.<\/p><p>So I think that the OAS General Assembly was of I mean, the conversations that we held there, I think, were of great concern to us. And moving forward, we want to find ways to strengthen and yes, reform, in part the inter-American human rights system, but not to destroy it.<\/p><p>And I will say I just want to be clear about this that unfortunately, it became clear at the General Assembly that some peoples goals wasnt reform. In fact, they didnt even use the words reform. They used the words destruction. And that to me it wasnt me interpreting those words; it was what was said. So having that out on the table, maybe now we can talk about how to reform the system and in fact continue to strengthen it, even when we dont like its decisions all the time, as will happen.<\/p><p>I do think that moving ahead on the issue of Paraguay, we have an opportunity here in the hemisphere. We have an opportunity to work together on an issue that concerns all of us, which is strengthening democracy and strengthening dialogue in Paraguay. I think the way the OAS has gone about this has been very healthy and very productive, but I think there are important roles for countries in South America. And we will continue to work, for example, with Brazil on this issue very closely. We will continue to be in contact with our colleagues in Chile, in Colombia, in Peru. All of those countries are important to moving this ahead and finding a constructive outcome, which I think everybody wants. We have had good conversations with our Uruguayan counterparts.<\/p><p>So I dont I see Paraguay in some ways as a way for us to come together as a region to support Paraguayan democracy, not as an issue which will exacerbate divisions.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Could you expand your comment regarding the attacks against El Norte, if possible?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Right. I mean, the only thing I want to say about that is we have seen, obviously, violence against journalists, individual journalists, but also against newspapers or other media outlets in Mexico in the past. These attacks just unfortunately sort of continue or take that to another level, and they have to be rejected by everyone. And one of the things that worries me the most in Mexico is the threat of physical violence, which causes both, obviously, an inability to report stories just because of physical harm but also leads to self-censorship, if were not careful, because of fear, a climate of fear.<\/p><p>And so I think that we all have to stand up and speak out against that kind of violence and hope to work with the government, because I think the current government has made it very clear that they dont accept those kinds of attacks and that they want to work on resolving those cases and reducing the incidents of violence against journalists and media outlets, and that well do everything we can to help in that area.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Im afraid were out of time. I want to thank Assistant Secretary Jacobson for coming here. I hope you return soon.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thank you very much.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you.<\/p><\/body>","83":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Speech to text transcript:<\/emphasis><footnote><anchor id=\"fnote01\"\/><label>1<\/label><bodyText><p>This copy is computer generated.
