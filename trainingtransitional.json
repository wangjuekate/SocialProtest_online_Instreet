All mobile internet services have been shut down in Ethiopia for\u00a0the last seven days, amid increasingly violent\u00a0protest scenes and a recently declared a 'state of emergency'.[1] Demonstrations have taken place with regular frequency\u00a0in Ethiopia's\u00a0Oromia[2]\u00a0region since November 2015, with protesters demanding greater self-rule, freedom and respect for the ethnic identity of the Oromo people, who have experienced systematic marginalization and persecution over the last quarter century.\u00a0Authorities have used deadly force[3] against the protesters on more than one occasion. <\/p><p>On October 2 alone, 52 people were killed[4]. The\u00a0Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC), an opposition party, has reported a death toll[5] of nearly 600 people. While select social media and messaging platforms such as WhatsApp have been shut down sporadically as protests have grown more intense, in Addis Ababa, the capital, this is\u00a0the longest sustained mobile Internet service shutdown that has taken place since they began. The sudden silence of the protests on social media has left those\u00a0tracking the\u00a0movement\u00a0over Facebook and Twitter worried.Mobile internet, social media cut for +7 days in the 'African capital' #AddisAbaba[6].

Activists fear that the protest movement, which has\u00a0relied on social media both for coordination and for circulating their message to international audiences, will be severed from their primary means of communication. Despite low Internet penetration in Ethiopia,\u00a0social media are becoming essential\u00a0\u2014especially for the protest movements in Oromia and Amhara regional states. Newsfeeds from Facebook pages and Twitter feeds from Ethiopia are not showing the same abundance of posts as they were a week ago. How #Ethiopia[8] censors Facebook.

In June they blocked social media in the name of preventing exams leaks, but now it is not clear whether\u00a0te government is switching off all mobile internet services as a precursor to the ongoing protest, or if the\u00a0measure is intended as\u00a0a reaction to protests. Those close to the situation fear this may\u00a0be\u00a0the beginning of a dangerous new phase after 12 months of protests.

In that ruling, U.S.<person><nameText>Circuit Judge David Tatel <\/nameText><\/person>says[1]:<\/p><p><br\/><br\/>\"Given that the Commission has chosen to classify broadband providers in a manner that exempts them from treatment as common carriers, the Communications Act expressly prohibits the Commission from nonetheless regulating them as such. Because the Commission has failed to establish that the anti-discrimination and anti-blocking rules do not impose per se common carrier obligations, we vacate those portions of the Open Internet Order.\"<br\/> The Open Internet Order Tatel speaks about refers to the December 2010 order [2] in which the FCC defines open internet as:<br\/> \"A level playing field where consumers can make their own choices about what applications and services to use, and where consumers are free to decide what content they want to access, create, or share with others.\"<br\/> It further states that the order would ensure:<br\/> 1. Transparency: That all ISPs must transparently disclose to their subscribers and users all relevant information as to the policies that govern their network<br\/> 2. No Blocking: That no legal content may be blocked<br\/> 3. No Unreasonable Discrimination: That ISPs may not act in a commercially unreasonable manner to harm the Internet, including favoring the traffic from an affiliated entity.<br\/> Although the principles behind the order, that Internet service providers (ISP) should treat all Internet traffic the same, should not block or slow down traffic or modify services based on the traffic to and from sites, seems fair and reasonable, many major ISP's immediately began challenging the order. The Verizon challenge and subsequent ruling virtually eliminated those principles. <br\/> In light of the ruling, the FCC proposed a rules change in May of this year. The changes would essentially clear the way for ISP's to offer so called \"fast lanes\" to higher paying customers. For example, Verizon, Comast or another ISP could force Netflix, Meetup, Etsy or any online company to pay a premium to have their services in the \"fast lane\" and ensure customers receive quality, uninterrupted content. Although many may not have much sympathy to major conglomerates such at Netflix, the idea of paying for \"fast lanes\" could put an undo burden on smaller competitors, thus potentially eliminating the idea of a fair marketplace. <br\/> The idea of unequal treatment for content providers and customers is seen as a threat to the idea of net neutrality, the idea that no portion of Internet information should be prioritized over another.<br\/> Reddit co-founder, Alexis Ohanian, calls[3] the Internet \"the most democratic vehicle for free expression the world has ever known.\" He argues that the Internet is a free market that allows both small and large businesses and equal playing field and allows the average person the opportunity to create \"tomorrow's Google or next year's Facebook.\"<br\/> The idea that the principles of net neutrality and an open Internet are in jeopardy spawned Internet Slowdown Day. The protest is organized by Fight for the Future[4], which believes the proposed rule change[5] would create a two-tiered Internet. Fight for the Future told CNET[6] the two-tiered system would mean \"slow lanes (for most of us) and fast lanes (for wealthy corporations that are willing to pay fees in exchange for fast service).\" This would \"discriminate against online content and applications.\"<br\/> Battle for the Net[7] has also joined in the cause, saying:<br\/> \"Cable companies would have the power to discriminate against online content and applications \u2014 they could pick winners and losers, shake sites down for fees, block content for political reasons, and make it easier for Internet users to view cable content. (For instance, Comcast owns NBC, and so has incentives to make it easier to view NBC content than that of other providers.)\"<br\/> Top websites such as Netflix, Meetup, Reddit, Foursquare, Vimeo and Wordpress are also taking up the cause and participating in \"Slowdown Day.\" As a way of showing their support, they will post various graphics on their sites as a sign of solidarity and support for an open Internet. <br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>Tumblr plans on releasing a video about net neutrality, as well as urge users to use a net neutrality hashtag in social media posts and e-mail lawmakers in Congress. Tumblr also issued a statement saying:<br\/> \"A multi-tiered system, catered purely to the economic interests of broadband providers with termination monopolies to end consumers, will undoubtedly harm innovation and competition in industries reliant on the Internet (a set of industries that now extends far beyond the usual 'tech' sector) and stifle free expression for millions of users of Tumblr.\"<br\/> Individuals are asked to show their support by changing their Twitter or other social media profile photos to a spinning loading icon. It is estimated that a million or more people will participate in the protest in one way or another. <br\/><br\/><br\/>According to a Washington Post report[8], the FCC has received 1.1 million people comments regarding the rules change, with only approximately one percent of the comments showing support for the change. <br\/> The protest may already be seeing results before it can really begin. Engine, a Silicon Valley lobby group, told the Guardian[9]:<br\/> 'With over one million public comments already filed with the FCC, much has been written about why the FCC's proposed rules would damage the internet, but the FCC needs to see firsthand how Internet fast lanes would devastate startups.' <br\/> Those comments have caused FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler to backtrack from the proposed rules change, saying[10] the FCC will not allow creation of Internet of \"haves\" and \"have-nots\". <br\/> Although the protest will not actually \"slow down\" the Internet, organizers believes it sends a strong message to not only FCC, but to IPS's such as Comcast and Verizon. With Wheeler seemingly succumbing to mounting pressure from the public, it remains to be seen what if any impact \"Slowdown Day\" will have on the major ISP's. With growing public outcry against the a push to eliminate the idea of an equal and neutral Internet, one can only hope the fear of customer outrage will encourage them to embrace the principle of an open Internet. <br\/><br\/>Play Video[11]<br\/> [1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.cadc.uscourts.gov\/internet\/opinions.nsf\/3AF8B4D938CDEEA685257C6000532062\/%24file\/11-1355-1474943.pdf\">http:\/\/www.cadc.uscourts.gov\/internet\/opinions.nsf\/3AF8B4D938CDEEA685257C6000532062\/%24file\/11-1355-1474943.pdf<\/url> [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.fcc.gov\/guides\/open-internet\">http:\/\/www.fcc.gov\/guides\/open-internet<\/url> [3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2014\/9\/8\/6122675\/right-now-the-internet-needs-your-help-to-survive\">http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2014\/9\/8\/6122675\/right-now-the-internet-needs-your-help-to-survive<\/url> [4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https:\/\/www.fightforthefuture.org\">https:\/\/www.fightforthefuture.org<\/url>\/ [5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https:\/\/apps.fcc.gov\/edocs_public\/attachmatch\/DOC-327104A1.pdf\">https:\/\/apps.fcc.gov\/edocs_public\/attachmatch\/DOC-327104A1.pdf<\/url> [6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/top-websites-join-internet-slowdown-day-in-symbolic-protest-of-fast-lanes\/\">http:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/top-websites-join-internet-slowdown-day-in-symbolic-protest-of-fast-lanes\/<\/url> [7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https:\/\/www.battleforthenet.com\">https:\/\/www.battleforthenet.com<\/url>\/ [8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/the-switch\/wp\/2014\/09\/02\/sunlight-99-percent-of-net-neutrality-comments-wanted-stronger-fcc-rules\/\">http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/the-switch\/wp\/2014\/09\/02\/sunlight-99-percent-of-net-neutrality-comments-wanted-stronger-fcc-rules\/<\/url> [9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2014\/sep\/04\/etsy-mozilla-reddit-protest-net-neutrality\">http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2014\/sep\/04\/etsy-mozilla-reddit-protest-net-neutrality<\/url> [10]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/top-websites-join-internet-slowdown-day-in-symbolic-protest-of-fast-lanes\/\">http:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/top-websites-join-internet-slowdown-day-in-symbolic-protest-of-fast-lanes\/<\/url> [11]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/fpbOEoRrHyU?wmode=transparent\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/fpbOEoRrHyU?wmode=transparent<\/url><\/p><p\/><\/body>","1417":"Nyc after stage-in protest against MicrosoftMore than 70 anti-ICE protesters arrested in NYC after stage-in protest against Microsoft","536":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Brazilians swept through the streets across the country Sunday for an anti-government protest demanding the removal of <person><nameText>President Dilma Rousseff.<\/nameText><\/person><br\/>Called out mostly by activist groups via social media, Sunday's protests were sparked by their anger over an eroding economy and a corruption scandal that has implicated politicians in Rousseff's Workers Party, leaving Rousseff fighting for her political life, according to Fox News Latino.<\/p><p><br\/>Many marched wearing the green, yellow and blue colors of Brazil.

All mobile internet services have been shut down in Ethiopia for\u00a0the last seven days, amid increasingly violent\u00a0protest scenes and a recently declared a 'state of emergency'.[1] Demonstrations have taken place with regular frequency\u00a0in Ethiopia's\u00a0Oromia[2]\u00a0region since November 2015, with protesters demanding greater self-rule, freedom and respect for the ethnic identity of the Oromo people, who have experienced systematic marginalization and persecution over the last quarter century.\u00a0Authorities have used deadly force[3] against the protesters on more than one occasion. <\/p><p>On October 2 alone, 52 people were killed[4]. The\u00a0Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC), an opposition party, has reported a death toll[5] of nearly 600 people. While select social media and messaging platforms such as WhatsApp have been shut down sporadically as protests have grown more intense, in Addis Ababa, the capital, this is\u00a0the longest sustained mobile Internet service shutdown that has taken place since they began. The sudden silence of the protests on social media has left those\u00a0tracking the\u00a0movement\u00a0over Facebook and Twitter worried.Mobile internet, social media cut for +7 days in the 'African capital' #AddisAbaba[6]. Gov spox says service will be back 'when deemed safe' \u2014 Karim Lebhour (@KaLebhour) October 11, 2016[7] The mobile Internet blackout is also likely resulting in\u00a0a decrease in online\u00a0news about the protests. Activists fear that the protest movement, which has\u00a0relied on social media both for coordination and for circulating their message to international audiences, will be severed from their primary means of communication. Despite low Internet penetration in Ethiopia,\u00a0social media are becoming essential\u00a0\u2014especially for the protest movements in Oromia and Amhara regional states. Newsfeeds from Facebook pages and Twitter feeds from Ethiopia are not showing the same abundance of posts as they were a week ago. How #Ethiopia[8] censors Facebook.

In June they blocked social media in the name of preventing exams leaks, but now it is not clear whether\u00a0te government is switching off all mobile internet services as a precursor to the ongoing protest, or if the\u00a0measure is intended as\u00a0a reaction to protests. Those close to the situation fear this may\u00a0be\u00a0the beginning of a dangerous new phase after 12 months of protests.

We stand in solidarity with those that oppose the advertisement and agree that PepsiCo Inc. was right in removing their advertisement.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">PepsiCo Inc. released an advertisement April 4 in hopes of illustrating a \"global message of unity, peace and understanding,\" according to a statement by PepsiCo Inc.<\/p><p>Instead, the internet banded together against the commercial that downplayed the Black Lives Matter movement and other protests by showing that if someone had brought a soda, all of the conflict would cease. The advertisement was pulled the next day after over 1.6 million people viewed the YouTube video with five times more downvotes than upvotes.<\/p><p>\"PepsiCo Inc. just pushed out a commercial to try to make a statement, but it was just confusing, and they basically exploited the protests going on, especially Black Lives Matter,\" said Rachel Frainy, senior communication and journalism major. \"It's unacceptable to exploit real world problems by using a celebrity for branding purposes.\"<\/p><p>PepsiCo Inc. should not use controversial topics or celebrities in order to sell their product, influence people to take a certain stance or make their product seem like something that could save someone or make them a better person.<\/p><p>\"If only daddy would have known about the power of Pepsi,\" said Bernice King, daughter of <person><nameText>Martin Luther King, <\/nameText><\/person>Jr. in an April 5 Tweet.<\/p><p>Through different social media outlets, people expressed their opinions and stood strong with each other. Not only were all generations responding, but activists and movement leaders took over the internet to show the truth to the advertisement.<\/p><p>\"If I had carried Pepsi, I guess I never would've gotten arrested. Who knew?\" said Deray McKesson, civil rights activist and co-founder of Campaign Zero, a police reform campaign, in an April 4 Tweet.<\/p><p>Many of social media's responses denouncing the advertisement are accurate. Not only did PepsiCo Inc. trivialize social movements throughout history, but they also offended many that have been involved with and aware of the movements that were minimized, causing controversy. The internet has taken to calling the insensitive advertisement tone-deaf, and the Editorial Board stands behind them.<\/p><p>\"I didn't really get the unity idea. I see that they tried, but to me, the overall message was that anything can be solved with a Pepsi - whether that be racial tensions or police brutality,\" said freshman psychology major Alyson Godbolt. \"Let's just all have a Pepsi, and everything will be okay, and as nice as that sounds, it is not that simple.\"<\/p><p>The advertisement begins with Kendall Jenner quitting a photoshoot, throwing her wig off and joining a mass of protesters. She makes it to the front of the protest where she grabs a Pepsi, walks up to the police line and hands an officer the soda. Right after this, everyone begins hugging and cheering, and the police break into smiles.<\/p><p>\"I saw the direct parallel to recent protests, particularly with police and Black Lives Matter,\" said Gena Flynn, director of the Center for Black Studies. \"By having that all go away from drinking a soda, it really doesn't take into account the serious nature of the protest activity that's been happening and the ongoing issues that are happening in the world in general.\"<\/p><p>Protesters have demonstrated peace and offered a helping hand to the opposing side many times. In 1967, Bernie Boston of the Washington Post photographed anti-Vietnam demonstrators facing police that were blocking the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia. The demonstrators stuck flowers into the barrels of the police officers' guns.<\/p><p>In 2015, during the Baltimore protests, a child carrying an armful of water bottles walked around offering them to police. The photo went viral on Facebook after being shared 69,037 times. Photographer Bishop Cromartie said the police would not accept the water bottles. Neither of these two peaceful offerings made a difference in the protest, and neither resulted with everyone unifying like in the PepsiCo Inc. advertisement.<\/p><p>\"There is a picture of Ieshia Evans [during the Baton Rouge protests], who is protesting by standing in front of officers, and it is very powerful, and many people made a connection between the two,\" Godbolt said. \"It took this black woman strength and courage to stand in front of her oppressors, and Kendall Jenner is just handing them a Pepsi, which does not amount to what Ieshia was doing.\"<\/p><p>The Editorial Board acknowledges PepsiCo Inc. for removing the advertisement, but to keep instances like this from happening again, PepsiCo Inc. should consider hiring a more diverse marketing team and consultants that represent our current world and can shed light on why an idea like this should be avoided. If more people were brought in, there is a chance the red flags could have been caught. Aside from this, PepsiCo Inc. should also think about staying away from controversial topics just to sell their product.<\/p><p>\"To dismiss the signs of protests that haven't been peaceful is almost a slap in the face to protesters and things that have been happening. The fact that nobody caught what could end up being offensive - what did end up being offensive - it just speaks to a lack of understanding amongst the people who are planning for these types of projects,\" Flynn said.<\/p><\/body>","783":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">ST.

They were blocking the street and causing a disturbance. That's what resulted in the arrests.\"<\/p><p>No officers were injured, but the window of a police cruiser was smashed. O'Toole said it appeared someone hit the car's windshield with a brick or bat.<\/p><p>\"I believe our response was good, and we had no issues with the 135 other people that were there,\" he said.<\/p><p>The activists continued their protests Friday. About 200 people marched on the Missouri Botanical Garden to show opposition to biotech giant Monsanto Co., a sponsor of the attraction.

But when a professor recommended he should consider a career at the Treasury Department, it changed his professional life forever.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I started training to be a Special Agent, Love said. \"When I went through the specialized training for financial crimes, I took to it right away.\"<\/p><p>That decision was the start of a long career in financial crimes and fraud and risk management that started with the Treasury Department and then spanned to consulting jobs and major roles in the private sector. TD is now reaping the rewards of his wide-ranging and in-depth experience in the newly created role as Head Fraud Risk Management (FRM) &amp;#38; Global Security Investigations (GSI).<\/p><p>Love's new role is to lead the two teams of over 220 colleagues critical to ensuring the bank's success in the battle against financial fraud - one responsible with oversight of the fraud risk management framework and the other with actual implementations of security measures.<\/p><p>New Fraud Risk Management team created to meet today's challenges<\/p><p>The new Fraud Risk Management team has global oversite as a second line of defense to the current teams that work with each business. Love is focused on ensuring the best fraud risk management control and governance structures are being applied across the Bank. It will set the standards to implement controls to combat fraud to provide TD customers with greater certainty that their transactions are safe and secure.<\/p><p>\"The times have changed as new products are coming out,\" Love said. \"Criminals are not just attacking banks from the common way of walking in and robbing a bank, but through cyber capabilities. With the different ways to try to commit fraud, this new team is an enhancement to controls we have already established.\"<\/p><p>Most members of this new team have deep corporate experience in this area, which will be needed to find success with all the challenges. The team must be both disruptors in questioning how fraud risk is currently managed and creating a new framework, which may create significant changes. They also need to be diplomats, ensuring they can establish the close relationships required for the best results.<\/p><p>Global Security Investigations team has vital role<\/p><p>The GSI team has the responsibility for all investigations regarding physical assets, robberies, fraud and internal investigations. Beyond that, the team manages threats, which include a wide range of activities from protests, severe weather occurrences, such as hurricanes, and providing updates related to safety and security, including travel advisories.<\/p><p>Members of the team include colleagues who have worked in the law enforcement, risk management, fraud operations and the legal profession.<\/p><p>Fraud has potential to impact everyone<\/p><p>Love's extensive experience included a role at PayPal more than a decade ago, which gave him particularly good insights into the types of fraud in the online marketplace that he has built upon to inform his decisions today.<\/p><p>\"There are differences from back then, people are online more today and more connected via their mobile phones and via social media sites,\" he explained. \"But fraud is fraud, today it is just carried out over multiple channels.\"<\/p><p>He noted that millennials and younger generations tend to be more trusting of using online tools to conduct business, so they may be more susceptible in that area compared with older generations. But the older generations are more likely to be impacted by fraud conducted through robocalls and other more traditional ways.<\/p><p>\"But again, with the account takeover, identity theft and people being able to access information, whether it's via the phone, via online or just other social engineering, I think everyone can potentially be impacted,\" he said.<\/p><p>Education is an important key for prevention<\/p><p>The best weapon in the fight for prevention is education. Love notes that banks who are fierce rivals in every other way, meet regularly with both federal and local regulators to learn about new threats and prevention methods.<\/p><p>Education is also going to play a more visible role at TD for both employees and customers. Currently, Love's team is planning to work with other stakeholders and hold sessions to create content, available online and in-person at Store locations that will provide information to both audiences to more fully inform them about how to avoid fraud and ways to identify it. \"Too often it happens once there's a big breach, then you'll hear all the news reports, and everybody will say, 'remember to protect your personal information,' \" he explained. \"I am saying why can't we do that more frequently?\" To make the public more often aware would be beneficial and that is what we will be doing.\"<\/p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services<\/p><p>MSTRUCK-6909228 MSTRUCK<\/p><\/body>","294":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Hourly In Play (R)<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Updated: 29-Apr-14 17:00 ET<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">16:55<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">PNRA Panera Bread beats by $0.03, beats on revs; guides Q2 EPS below consensus; guides FY14 EPS in-line (163.18 -0.15)<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $1.55 per share, $0.03 better than the Capital IQ Consensus Estimate of $1.52; revenues rose 7.7% year\/year to $605.3 mln vs the $597.5 mln consensus.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Co issues downside guidance for Q2, sees EPS of $1.70-1.76 vs. $1.86 Capital IQ Consensus Estimate, which would represent a range of a decrease of 2% to an increase of 1% in fiscal Q2 2014 versus the comparable period in fiscal 2013.

The primary goal of the study is to determine the anti-tumor activity of single agent Selinexor in up to 30 patients with relapsed glioblastoma (grade 4 glioma), as well as to document brain penetration of Selinexor and determine tolerability in this population. Selinexor is a covalent inhibitor of the nuclear export protein XPO1 that forces the accumulation and activation of multiple tumor suppressor proteins in the nucleus. This leads to induction of apoptosis in neoplastic cells, while largely sparing normal cells. Preclinical results have shown that Selinexor kills glioblastoma neurospheres in culture, crosses the blood brain barrier of animals and has activity against glioblastoma xenografts and primagrafts with various genetic lesions.<\/p><p>16:14<\/p><p>TRLA Trulia misses by $0.02, beats on revs; guides Q2 revs above consensus; guides FY14 revs above consensus (32.91 2.45)<\/p><p>Reports Q1 (Mar) loss of $0.14 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 worse than the Capital IQ Consensus Estimate of ($0.12); revenues rose 127.1% year\/year to $54.5 mln vs the $53.47 mln consensus.<\/p><p>Marketplace revenue of $45.8 million, up 155% year-over-year.

Momentum names, meanwhile, rebounded from yesterday's relative weakness, which allowed the Nasdaq Composite (+0.7%) to finish ahead of the benchmark index.<\/p><p>Equity indices began the session on an upbeat note, slowly building on their early gains throughout the afternoon. The energy sector (+0.4%) powered the opening advance thanks to better than expected earnings from BP (BP 50.29, +1.25) and Valero Energy (VLO 56.84, -1.13). BP surged 2.6%, while Valero displayed early strength, but spent the session in a steady retreat from its opening high, which mirrored the price action of the entire sector.<\/p><p>The solid early gain in the energy sector kept the S&amp;P 500 in the green during the first hour of action, while the Nasdaq briefly dipped into the red. The short-lived weakness in the tech-heavy index resulted from the underperformance of top-weighted components, but those names were able to rebound. For its part, the broader technology sector advanced 0.7%, finishing only behind the financial sector (+1.0%).<\/p><p>The economically-sensitive financial sector drew strength from a slew of top components, with Bank of America (BAC 15.24, +0.29) leading the charge. The stock gained 1.9% following yesterday's 6.3% loss. International financials had an even better showing, with Deutsche Bank (DB 44.45, +0.88) gaining 2.0% after reporting above-consensus results. Also of note, Standard &amp; Poor's lowered the ratings of 15 European banks-including Deutsche Bank-to 'Negative' from 'Stable,' but the stock saw little reaction to the news.<\/p><p>In addition to receiving support from two of its largest sectors, the market was also underpinned by the health care space (+0.6%), where Dow component Merck (MRK 58.72, +2.04) rallied 3.6% in reaction to its bottom-line beat. Biotechnology, meanwhile, played along today as the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB 229.09, +6.03) gained 2.7%.<\/p><p>On the downside, consumer staples (-0.4%) and utilities (-0.4%) posted modest losses, with the utilities sector narrowing its 2014 gain to 13.4%.<\/p><p>Treasuries finished the session with slim gains, punctuating their session-long retreat from overnight lows. As a result, the benchmark 10-yr yield slipped one basis point to 2.69%.<\/p><p>Participation was essentially in line with average as 724 million shares changed hands at the NYSE floor.<\/p><p>Today's economic data featured two reports:<\/p><p>The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index fell to 82.3 in April from an upwardly revised 83.9 (from 82.3) in March. The Briefing.com consensus pegged the Consumer Confidence Index at 83.5. The Present Situation Index fell to 78.3 in April from 82.5 in March. The Expectations Index increased slightly, from 84.8 in March to 84.9 in April. The overall decline in confidence was a little unusual. Typically, confidence levels trend with employment conditions, equity prices, gasoline costs, and media reports. Extremely low layoff levels coupled with a generally rising stock market in April resulted in a large increase in the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index. Those factors were expected, yet they failed to push the Consumer Confidence Index higher. The Case-Shiller 20-city Home Price Index for February rose 13.2% while a 13.0% increase had been expected by the Briefing.com consensus. This follows the previous month's increase of 13.2%.

Co's 2014 operating EPS guidance based on yen: Yen rate 95: $6.40-6.58. Yen Rate 97.54 $6.31-6.49. Yen Rate 100 $6.22-6.40. Yen Rate 105 $6.08-6.24. Yen Rate 110 $5.91-6.09.In yen terms, Aflac Japan's premium income rose 1.4% in the first quarter. Net investment income increased 9.4%. Investment income growth was magnified by the weaker yen\/dollar exchange rate because approximately 45% of Aflac Japan's first quarter investment income was dollar-denominated, compared with 40% a year ago. Total revenues were up 2.2% in the first quarter. The pretax operating profit margin increased in the first quarter to 22.0% from 21.5% in the prior year. Pretax operating earnings in yen increased 4.6% on a reported basis and 1.5% on a currency-neutral basis. Aflac U.S. premium income increased 1.1% to $1.3 billion in the first quarter. Net investment income was up 2.5% to $161 million. Total revenues increased 1.2% to $1.5 billion. The pretax operating profit margin increased to 20.8% from 19.5% a year ago, reflecting improvements in both the benefit and expense ratios. Pretax operating earnings were $303 million, an increase of 7.9% for the quarter. Outlook: \"We are pleased with our overall financial results in the first quarter of 2014. Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor, generated strong financial results for the quarter. As we anticipated, Aflac Japan's total new annualized premium sales in the first quarter were down significantly following difficult comparisons to the prior year when first sector sales increased dramatically ahead of a premium rate increase in April 2013 that was prompted by declines in interest rates. While Aflac Japan's third sector product sales were lower than expected, we remain encouraged by the long-term sales growth potential as we continue to expand and enhance our distribution channels. As such, we continue to expect that Aflac Japan's sales of third sector products will increase 2% to 7% for the year.<\/p><p>15:45<\/p><p>SYN Synthetic Biologics reports UCLA announcement of preliminary positive topline efficacy and safety results from Phase 2 study of Trimesta for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (2.77 -0.14)<\/p><p>Co reported that the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) School of Medicine announced preliminary, positive topline data from the Phase II clinical trial evaluating Trimesta (oral estriol), the Company's oral, once-daily treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in women.

In the study in infants with SMA, a total of 15 infants have been dosed as of April 7, four infants in the 6 mg cohort and 11 infants in the 12 mg cohort. The 12 mg cohort is continuing to enroll patients. In the 12 mg cohort:<\/p><p>Seven infants have received all three induction doses and been evaluated after their last induction dose. These patients constitute the per protocol efficacy population (PPEP). Of these seven, five are alive without the need for permanent ventilation. The two infants who have had an event (one death and one permanent ventilation) each experienced the event in connection with pneumonia. The median age of the infants in the PPEP in the 12 mg cohort is 9.6 months (calculated using age at event or on April 7 for patients who have not experienced an event). Three of the infants not included in the PPEP remain on study and had not yet reached their third induction dose on April 7. One infant died prior to receiving a third induction dose.<\/p><p>In the 6 mg cohort:<\/p><p>The PPEP in this cohort is comprised of all four infants dosed. Two infants are alive without the need for permanent ventilation, one is currently on long-term ventilation and one infant, unfortunately, died due to an accident. The median age of the infants in the 6 mg cohort is 14 months (calculated using age at event or on April 7 for patients who did not experience an event).<\/p><p>Although the study was not designed to provide evidence of improvement in functional activity, increases in muscle function scores were observed in infants in both cohorts using the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP INTEND), a motor assessment test that evaluates muscle strength in infants with SMA. In infants treated to date, ISIS-SMNRx has been well tolerated with most infants treated with the 12 mg dose. Isis plans to initiate a Phase 3 clinical study in infants with SMA mid-year.<\/p><p>Results from Phase 2 study in children with SMA: In the study in children with SMA, time and dose-dependent increases in muscle function scores, as measured by the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded (HFMSE), were observed in children treated with multiple-doses of ISIS-SMNRx. Children in the 3 mg, 6 mg and 9 mg cohorts achieved mean increases of 1.5, 2.3 and 3.7 points, respectively nine months following the first dose. Encouraging preliminary results were also observed in two additional functional tests: the six-minute walk test (6MWT), and the upper limb module (ULM) test. In the 6MWT, performed with nine ambulatory children, a mean increase of 22.7 meters was observed at 9 months. In the ULM test, which utilizes a 9 item scale (max score of 18), performed with 10 non-ambulatory children, a mean increase of 2.3 was observed at 9 months. In all children treated with ISIS-SMNRx to date, the drug has been well tolerated at doses as high as 12 mg. \"We are on track to start the Phase 3 study in children with SMA later this year.\"<\/p><p>13:00<\/p><p>WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Nasdaq Outperforms<\/p><p>At midday, the major averages hover just below their best levels of the session, with the Nasdaq Composite (+0.8%) trading a bit ahead of its peers.<\/p><p>Even though the Nasdaq outperforms at this juncture, the index lagged in the morning, making a brief appearance in the red.

The financial sector (+0.9%) outperforms, thanks to solid gains in some of the most influential listings, while the consumer discretionary space (+0.5%) lags.

The Expectations Index increased slightly, from 84.8 in March to 84.9 in April. The overall decline in confidence was a little unusual. Typically, confidence levels trend with employment conditions, equity prices, gasoline costs, and media reports. Extremely low layoff levels coupled with a generally rising stock market in April resulted in a large increase in the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index. Those factors were expected, yet they failed to push the Consumer Confidence Index higher.

Expectations are for the Fed to continue its current $10 bln taper so focus will be on the language surrounding that news. Economic data was light today with the Case Shiller Housing Price Index and Consumer Confidence figures both falling short of expectations. The euro is weaker this morning after Germany posted a lower than expected inflation number. This will set the tone for tomorrow's EU inflation report. ECB members have said that they will monitor this quite closely so market participants believe a low number could drive the central bank into action. Of interest, private loans in the EU were down which may raise expectations for the ECB to lower deposit rates into negative territory. In addition, there were headlines that France's Hollande plans to raise the question of the euro strength following May EU elections. The pound remains strong despite seeing its preliminary look at Q1 GDP fall short of expectations. Expectations were high and the currency has been able to firmly hold the 1.68 level which has helped offset the miss. The yen remains in the 102 area as we await another Bank of Japan meeting. The central bank is not expected to take any action tonight but commentary around the consumption tax hike and the impact it is having on the economy will be closely watched (BONDX, FOREX).<\/p><p>11:01<\/p><p>MNGA Magnegas confirmed that Sidney Lee Welding has completed MagneGas Distributor training and has received their first customer order (1.24 +0.04)<\/p><p>10:52<\/p><p>TECHX Relative sector strength on intraday upswing -Technical-<\/p><p>Sector outperforming the S&amp;P on the move over the last half hour include: Biotech IBB, Internet FDN, Discretionary XLY, Telecom IYZ, Software IGV.<\/p><p>10:33<\/p><p>SPY Stock indices edging back off morning highs -- S&amp;P +4, Dow +52, Nasdaq Comp +2 -Technical-<\/p><p>The S&amp;P extended the rebound off yesterday's afternoon low to nearly 30 points but has pulled back modestly in recent trade.

Total depreciation, depletion, and amortization increased by a combined $0.13 per Mcfe, as more production from higher investment cost segments was in the mix. Higher volumes, conversely, spread fixed pipeline costs more broadly. Unit ad valorem, severance, and other taxes increased as a result of higher prices.

Gas price realizations increased, year-over-year, to $5.37 per Mcf from $4.21 per Mcf, while oil\/NGL\/condensate decreased to $53.95 per Bbl from $60.20 per Bbl, as the production of NGLs expanded faster than oil and condensate.

Banco Santander will offer a 20% premium over the last closing market price. The consideration offered under the transaction, which is expected to be completed by October, would be paid by means of Banco Santander shares.The offer is voluntary and, therefore, minority holders of Santander Brasil may choose whether or not to participate in the transaction, which is not subject to a minimum acceptance level. Santander will acquire all shares held by shareholders accepting the offer and has no intention of causing the delisting of Santander Brasil from either the Sao Paulo stock exchange or the NYSE. Banco Santander shares will be traded on the Sao Paulo stock exchange through Brazilian Depositary Receipts.Shareholders who accept the offer will receive, through BDRs or through ADRs, 0.70 newly-issued shares of Banco Santander for every unit or ADR of Santander Brasil . If all shares held by minority shareholders were tendered in the offer, Banco Santander would have to issue ~ 665 mln shares, which represent 5.8% of the current share capital (EUR 4,686 mln).The transaction is also beneficial for the shareholders of Banco Santander, given that it will increase their EPS from the outset. The market consensus anticipates that Santander Brasil will obtain a profit close to 6,400 mln of reais brasileiros in 2015 (equal to ~ EUR 2,000 mln) from which, with its current share capital participation, ~ EUR 1,500 mln would be attributable to Grupo Santander. Therefore, if all shares held by minority shareholders are tendered in the offer, Santander Brasil would contribute to Grupo Santander with an additional amount of ~ EUR 500 mln in 2015, entailing a 1.3% increase in the EPS in 2015 and a 1.1% increase in the EPS in 2016. The impact of the transaction on the core capital would be almost neutral, since, in the event that all the minority shareholders accepted the offer, this would contribute three basis points to the core capital.<\/p><p>06:43<\/p><p>LRN K12 beats by $0.02, beats on revs; guides Q4 revs in-line (21.40 )<\/p><p>Reports Q3 (Mar) earnings of $0.40 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 better than the Capital IQ Consensus Estimate of $0.38; revenues rose 7.9% year\/year to $235.2 mln vs the $232.43 mln consensus.<\/p><p>Managed Public Schools - Average Student Enrollments were 124,964 +5.3%<\/p><p>International - Total Student Enrollments 5,686 +12.4% Guidance:<\/p><p>Co issues in-line guidance for Q4, sees Q4 revs of $217-227 mln vs. $221.70 mln Capital IQ Consensus Estimate.<\/p><p>Operating income in the range of $10-15 million.

This increase was primarily the result of a charge-off on one significant credit during the first quarter of 2014. Positively affecting net income for the quarter was a $9.9 million increase in net interest income, largely due to strong loan growth, the acquisition of Morrill &amp; Janes Bank and Trust Company completed during the last quarter of 2013 and a lower cost of funds. This improvement was offset by a $6.8 million decrease in gains on sale of loans held for sale, resulting from weaker mortgage loan volumes, and a $6.2 million increase in noninterest expenses, primarily due to the added expenses of Morrill &amp; Janes Bank and Trust Company.Net interest margin, expressed as a percentage of average earning assets, was 3.92% during the first quarter of 2014 compared to 3.82% during the fourth quarter of 2013 and 3.77% during the first quarter of 2013.<\/p><p>16:01<\/p><p>SGY Stone Energy announces Cardona South drilling success on the deep water Cardona South well at Mississippi Canyon 29 (44.68 -0.04)<\/p><p>Co announced success on the deep water Cardona South well at Mississippi Canyon 29.

Trump's actions since taking office have confirmed Mexico's worst fears. He's moving forward with a promise to construct a wall between the two countries. Preferential trade terms are up for renegotiation. <\/p><p>And detentions of Mexicans living in the US without proper visas are reportedly on the rise. Prospects for the Mexican economy are uncertain and the currency has depreciated sharply. Those who filed down Mexico City's main avenue, the Paseo de la Reforma, felt deeply offended. And they felt the need to express solidarity with their compatriots living without permits in the US. Signs urging Trump to \"build bridges\" and labelling the US president a \"bad hombre\" mixed with opportunistic vendors hawking essentials for a long walk in the hot sun-cold drinks, broad-brimmed hats, sunglasses-as well as nonessentials such as keychains, calendars and purses made of tortoise shells. Facing the marchers, clad entirely in white, Mari Contro fervently waved a Mexican flag. The retired secretary had driven with five friends from their retirement home on the southern edge of the capital to show support for Mexican migrants in the US. The women, who are in their 70s and 80s, agreed that Mexico's relationship with the US is at its worst moment in their lifetimes. As the crowd swelled, chants of \"Viva Mexico!\" succumbed to spontaneous bursts of the national anthem. At the foot of the Angel of Independence, the country's most sacred national monument, a half-dozen men burned an effigy of <person><nameText>Donald Trump. <\/nameText><\/person>They carried signs and wore t-shirts identifying themselves as deportees. One of the men, Samuel Morales, returned to Mexico in September. The 57-year-old restauranteur said he was deported because of tax evasion, which is a felony in the United States. After 25 years living in Virginia, he no longer feels at home in Mexico. And his job prospects are slim in a labor market that heavily favors the young. \"We're not thieves or criminals,\" Mr. Morales said. \"We went there to change our way of life. I don't think wanting to get ahead is a crime.\" An estimated six million Mexicans living in the US without permits are at risk of deportation. Their return would likely stem the flow to family members of remittances, which are Mexico's biggest source of foreign currency, ahead of oil or tourism. The World Bank estimates that Mexicans living abroad sent US$28.1 billion back home in 2016, making Mexico the world's fourth-biggest recipient of remittances. Between the wall, the crackdown on unauthorized immigrants, the threats to tear up trade deals and bullying companies into canceling investments in Mexico-it's like <person><nameText>Donald Trump <\/nameText><\/person>is hitting the Mexican economy on all sides. Through trade deals, economic growth and ever-deeper family ties, Mexicans had presumed they were valued members of the North American community. Parents encouraged children to learn English. US brands sold like hotcakes. Miami, not Cancun, was the hot beach destination. But after years of increasing integration, the U.S. and Mexico now feel like distant neighbors. \"The wall is a way of saying: Forget about North America,\" said Mauricio De Maria y Campos, a researcher with the Center for Economic Studies at the Colegio de Mexico, a prestigious private university in Mexico City. Mexico took a chance on free trade more than two decades ago. It began to shed protections for domestic industries in the 1980s. Then it looked north to the world's biggest consumer market. The North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada took effect in 1994. Mexican exports have nearly tripled since Nafta to account for 35% of gross domestic product (around 80% of those exports go to the US). For contrast, exports represent just 13% of Brazil's GDP. Annual imports into Mexico have also tripled since Nafta, to 37.5% of GDP, and Mexico has become a vocal advocate of global free trade. It made geographic and economic sense for Mexico to expand trade with its northern neighbors. But critics say that in feeding the export machine, policy makers neglected the domestic market and suppressed wages. Now many are pinning their hopes on the domestic economy to push Mexico through the headwinds coming from <person><nameText>Donald Trump. <\/nameText><\/person>Although lots of investment plans appear to be on hold--and that's likely to ripple through the broader economy--manufacturing won't diminish overnight and domestic consumption won't come to a halt, either. Private sector economists surveyed by the Mexican central bank in late January forecasted, on average, a 1.5% expansion for the Mexican economy this year. Industrial property is one of the sectors that has boomed as Mexico scaled the ranks as a manufacturing powerhouse. Yet even that sector is somewhat insulated thanks to logistics demands from retailers and consumer goods makers. Much of that logistics infrastructure is on the fringe of Mexico City, a metropolitan area that's home to nearly a fifth of the country's 120 million inhabitants and more than a quarter of its economic output. Space is tight and land is scarce in the metropolitan area. \"This area is pure consumption,\" said Rafael Arias, who oversees the central Mexico efforts of global property developer Prologis. \"People have to eat, they get sick, they need to dress themselves. This can't stop.\" From the driver's seat of a black SUV, Mr. Arias pointed toward one of Prologis' earliest projects in Mexico, a warehouse lined with loading docks that, from afar, looks like a giant spaceship landed in the middle of an endless cluster of tiny cinderblock homes. The homes and urban sprawl came after Prologis leveled hills and ravines almost two decades ago to erect the property on what was then the outskirts of Mexico City. Out of caution, Prologis has decided not to acquire more land in Mexico this year. And it won't develop any more industrial parks in the country unless specifically commissioned to do so by a client. Mexicans will muddle through economic hardship, as they are very good at suffering, figures Agust\u00edn Barrios Gomez, who sits on the task force for the future of the US-Mexico relationship at the Mexican Council on Foreign Relations. Mr. Barrios G\u00f3mez is the son of an influential Mexican newscaster-turned-ambassador. He was educated entirely abroad at top schools in Canada, the US and Spain. And a few years ago he served as a federal congressman. He chafes at the stereotypes and misconceptions of Mexicans overseas. Feeling profoundly frustrated by the insults hurled against Mexico during Trump's presidential campaign, he decided to make a video last year extolling positive aspects of the US-Mexico relationship. Mr. Barrios G\u00f3mez donned a slick black suit for the video and spoke in flawless English as he ticked off Mexico's selling points, such as its stature as the 11th largest world economy by purchasing power parity. Mexico City skyscrapers and monuments served as the backdrop, with Mr. Barrios G\u00f3mez remarking that the capital -the biggest city in the Western Hemisphere- \"isn't full of cacti and sombreros.\" The video got millions of hits. But Mr. Barrios G\u00f3mez still had a queasy gut-feeling that Mr. Trump would triumph. \"<person><nameText>Donald Trump <\/nameText><\/person>is president of the United States thanks to Mexico. Because of racism,\" Mr. Barrios Gomez said in an interview. \"Now you go to the US and think, 'Is he one of the good ones? Is this guy going to turn on me? Does he see me as innately inferior?'\" Much of the Mexican labor force was too young to remember life before Nafta. Market openings over the past three decades have reduced prices for consumer goods like clothing. Half of the country's households enjoy middle class incomes of US$15,000 to US$45,000 a year, according to Euromonitor International. Now those middle class lifestyles are in peril. Economists say it's anyone's guess how far the peso could fall. The currency has been reacting to <person><nameText>Donald Trump's <\/nameText><\/person>tweets more than Mexico's economic fundamentals. The Mexican peso lost a staggering 16% of its value against the US dollar during 2016, as Trump's disparaging comments pounded the country like a punching bag. Mexicans could feel their purchasing power drain away. Overseas tripped were cancelled. The Mexican central bank began hiking interest rates in an effort to contain inflation. Mexicans embraced a stoic optimism after Trump's November election win - after all, Mexico has made it through plenty of crises before - and tried to enjoy the Christmas holidays, which unofficially stretch from the Virgin of Guadalupe's December 12th feast day through Three King's Day on January 6th. But January kicked off with a bang. The Mexican government's decision to stop subsidizing gasoline led to widespread protests and looting. Then, amid unrelenting attacks from Trump, Ford Motor Co. abandoned construction of a $1.6 billion assembly plant in central Mexico. The ground had already been cleared and a metal frame erected in the state of San Luis Potos\u00ed when the auto maker pulled out. It was shaping up to be a rough year. The peso hit an all-time low against the US dollar of 22.05 on January 11th. Consumer confidence also hit a record low in January. As the peso tumbled, Abelardo Marcondes was busy organizing a Miami event to showcase the Latin American luxury market. It's a top-flight summit booked for April at the Four Seasons. Friends urged Mr. Marcondes to cancel the event, saying the foreign exchange hit was too much to bear. Mr. Marcondes carried on. He doesn't expect the Miami event to break even. But this isn't the first time the Sao Paulo native has embraced risk. He left investment banking in 2008-at the height of Mexico's devastating swine flu epidemic-to open a marketing firm for luxury goods in Mexico. Mr. Marcondes said several of his clients are also holding steadfast. Rolex and Bulgari, for instance, maintained their full 2017 marketing plans for Mexico rather than cutting back or freezing budgets. \"You can't be so pessimistic,\" said Mr. Marcondes. \"You'll generate your own crisis.\" The Mexican peso has recovered from its January low, making it the best performing currency so far this year in the emerging markets space, notes Gerardo Rodriguez, a senior investment strategist at BlackRock and former deputy finance minister for Mexico. The ongoing effort by Mexican officials to discuss the future of the country's relationship with the US \"brings oxygen\" to the markets, added Mr. Rodriguez, venturing that Mexican assets could well outperform this year given their depressed valuations. But Valeria Moy, an economist and director of Mexican think-tank Mexico Como Vamos, argues that it's folly for Mexican officials to rush to the negotiating table with their US counterparts. \"You don't want to be the first country to negotiate with Trump,\" she said. \"He's anxious to have quick and notorious victories.\" The Mexican government strategy aims to place three pressing topics on the table at once: trade, immigration and security. Officials vow to go tit-for-tat on trade, retaliating against higher tariffs with hikes for key US exports. Mexico could also pull cooperation from other areas. In recent years, Mexico has prevented hundreds of thousands of mostly Central American immigrants from crossing its southern border and eventually reaching the US. Expelling large numbers of Mexican migrants from the US, however, would give Mexico little incentive to stop additional immigrants en route to the US. Some days the US-Mexico relationship appears to deteriorate by the hour. And these ever-shifting winds create challenges for business. Mexican companies have largely shied away from strong political statements amid the rising tensions. One exception is privately held Jarritos, a fizzy Mexican soda sold in an array of rainbow colors. Jarritos commissioned Mexican actor Diego Luna to direct a video depicting generations of immigrants voyaging to the US. Mr. Luna also starred in a provocative commercial for Mexico's best-known beer brand, Corona, which is owned by Belgium-headquartered AB InBev. In the advertisement, Mr. Luna refers to <person><nameText>Donald Trump <\/nameText><\/person>as \"that crazy one\" and urges Mexicans to knock down the mental walls that separate them from success, as he leaps off buildings like Spider-Man. US firms with operations in Mexico are walking a fine line, though. Companies that attend the domestic market don't want to alienate their Mexican customer base. But many of their CEOs have been lining up for meetings with Mr. Trump, with some even looking for favors under the umbrella of the ?America First' agenda. Calls erupted in January for Mexicans to boycott beloved American brands like Starbucks coffee and Wal-Mart grocery stores. Activists urged Mexicans to fight back with their wallets by consuming products \"Made in Mexico.\" Starbucks was quick to defend its business, noting that its local unit is Mexican-owned and that it employs 7,000 Mexicans. Wal-Mart, which is Mexico's largest private sector employer, rolled out a social media campaign with videos of Mexican workers and suppliers talking about how Wal-Mart has improved their lives. With the slogan \"Committed to you and Mexico,\" Wal-Mart explained that Mexican products account for 93% of its Mexican sales. One video shows farm workers in central Mexico carefully selecting plump green beans destined for consumption in Mexican cities. Another features bushy oregano plants sloping down lush hills. Roosters crow while growers explain that thanks to Wal-Mart purchases of their crops, they can support their families without having to migrate to Mexican cities or to the US. Mexico's richest man, the telecom tycoon Carlos Slim, told reporters gathered for a packed January press conference that the summons to boycott was ill-conceived. \"These are American companies that have come to invest in Mexico, to give jobs in Mexico, to produce in Mexico,\" Slim said. The US has accounted for nearly half of all foreign direct investment into Mexico since 1999. But doubts about the future of US-Mexico trade are likely to curb foreign investment this year, predicts Carlos Serrano, chief economist at Mexico's biggest bank, BBVABancomer. \"Nobody forces companies to invest in Mexico,\" Mr. Serrano said. \"They come because it makes them more competitive.\" A number of companies are pushing forward with their Mexico plans. Charlotte-based steel maker Nucor is undertaking a $270 million plant in central Mexico to supply steel to automakers in the country. And German engineering firm Siemens has committed to invest $200 million in Mexico over the next decade. In announcing that investment, Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser described Mexico as \"one of the powerhouses for manufacturing in the world.\" The opportunities in Mexico are huge, he explained, because of the country's large population-double the population of Germany. Mr. Kaeser's February visit to Mexico was planned well before Trump won the presidency. He used the visit as a platform to express support for Mexico and to plead for tolerance, even though Mexico accounts for just 2% of Siemens' annual EUR80 billion in sales while the US supplies about a quarter. Speaking from a podium, Mr. Kaeser turned to Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo-who is charged with renegotiating trade terms with the US-to wish him success in the talks. \"Partners and friends, they never walk alone,\" Mr. Kaeser said. Mr. Guajardo responded that Siemens' investment in Mexico sends a powerful message of long-term commitment and trust. \"You were here before the Mexican Revolution,\" Mr. Guajardo said, returning Mr. Kaeser's gaze, \"and you are here after the Mexican Revolution. So anything we face from now on will be like a light wind.\" Mexico is prepared to exit Nafta, if necessary. It hopes to avoid a trade war with the United States. At the same time, it's looking to decrease its dependence on the US market by importing grains from South America and strengthening trade with Europe. Some companies operating in Mexico actually see opportunity in Mr. Trump. Dallas-based airline Southwest stepped into the hot seat in January with a written request to the US Department of Transportation for special consideration when it reassigns slots that Delta and leading Mexican carrier Aerom\u00e9xico must forfeit in Mexico City's congested airport in exchange for regulatory approval of their proposed merger. Granting US carrier requests for the highly desirable slots would be \"consistent with the Trump administration's clearly stated goal to put America's interests first,\" Southwest argued. It also noted that Mexican carriers have \"vastly more slots\" in the country's busiest airport. Even Mexican companies see opportunity. Enrique Escalante, chief executive of Grupo Cementos de Chihuahua, brazenly told Reuters in November that his company would be willing to sell cement and concrete to build a 3,200-kilometer wall along the US-Mexico border. Cementos Chihuahua, with two cement plants and two concrete plants just south of El Paso, Texas, sells the vast majority of its cement and concrete in the US. \"We can't be selective,\" Mr. Escalante said. \"We're an important producer in this area and we have to respect our clients on both sides of the border.\" Monterrey-based Cemex, which has dozens of plants along the border and is the largest cement company in the Americas, declined to comment on whether it would sell cement for the wall. But investors are hopeful it will. The company's share price has nearly doubled over the past year. Mexico's political and business classes are on high alert. They fear social upheaval. And they warn that an increasingly adversarial relationship with the US could clear the path for a homegrown brand of populism and nationalism in Mexico. On a Thursday afternoon in February, the head of a Mexican business chamber addressed hundreds of his fellow businessmen at a packed luncheon in the patio of a baroque XVIII-century building. Purple and yellow lights danced off arches and columns. Wine filled glasses. Pate\u00e9 appetizers sat on plates next to poached baby pears. The messages at these meetings have been the same for years: Mexico needs to battle corruption; Mexico needs to create more and better-paid jobs; Mexico needs to improve public education. But in the era of <person><nameText>Donald Trump, <\/nameText><\/person>those messages carry more urgency. Despite years of economic growth, the full embrace of free trade and breakneck levels of foreign direct investment, opportunities in Mexico are uneven. Half the country lives in poverty. The head of the chamber is Juan Pablo Casta\u00f1on, who operates a biotech firm and real estate businesses in the northwestern state of Sinaloa. \"We need to generate more wealth and distribute it better,\" Mr. Casta\u00f1on instructed his fellow businessmen. \"We should be a nation where nobody feels the need to leave in order to provide for a family.\"<\/p><\/body>","1512":"Protesters set fire to Wendy's restaurantProtesters set fire to Wendy's restaurant where Rayshard Brooks was fatally shot by police","1325":"Alphabet Inc.: to stage a protest against the company'sAlphabet exec Richard DeVaul resigns after sexual misconduct allegations","539":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\"\/><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Mar 04, 2014 (Digital Journal:<url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.digitaljournal.com\">http:\/\/www.digitaljournal.com<\/url> Delivered by Newstex)<br\/> Last November a global protest led by the leaderless collective Anonymous was held in hundreds of cities all over the world, including Olympia, Washington.<br\/> Leading up to the march, Bank of America partnered with Washington State Police to violate the first amendment rights of protesters angry about intrusive government and corporate control.<\/p><p><br\/> In emails released through court order, and posted on Scrib'd[1], it was revealed Senior U.S Crime and Intelligence Analyst Kim- Triplett-Kolerich interacted with WSP to spy on the social media activity of protesters ahead of the planned march in an effort to 'protect' police from 'protests\/arrests\/injury.' <br\/>In an introductory email, Triplett-Kolerich promised to troll the internet to find any intel on the march, claiming Bank of America employs twenty people whose sole job is to spy on social media. Kolerich kept in constant contact with the WSP regarding the possible outbreak of violence, as well as the possible usage of smart phones to record any actions of the police. <br\/> The emails revealed a clear partnership between the bank and the police to attack one group with a long history of agitating Bank of America.<br\/> Digital Journal contributor Justin King has extensively covered Anonymous. His relationship with the collective does not allow him to get any previous information about a campaign because it would put the collective and himself in jeopardy; however, he views the silence of Anonymous as an ominous sign for Bank of America. <br\/> 'The IRC channels won't even discuss Bank of America- typically what that means is that they are going to do something. If they weren't going to be up to something, they would talk about it more freely.' What could be next for Bank of America is another embarrassing leak that shows culpability in blatantly criminal conduct.<br\/> In February 2013, Anonymous hacked into the private e-mails, and spreadsheets of TEKsystems[2], a contractor hired Bank of America to monitor Anonymous and other hacker networks taking aim at the bank. The information included an email that suggested TEKsystems was able to identify the person behind an Anonymous Twitter handle. That leak, and others have not prevented massive corporations from conducting surveillance programs, because they have friends in high places, who allow corporations to act with impunity.<br\/>Bank of America is part of the Domestic Security Alliance Council[3], a partnership between corporations and the FBI that 'advances elements of the FBI and DHS missions' in preventing, deterring, and investigating criminal and terrorism acts...' The secretive partnership was revealed thanks to a Freedom of Information request by the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund. In the highly redacted documents Bank of America was shown to be working with the FBI, and other federal agencies to spy on Occupy Wall Street protestors. In a release[4] explaining what was found, Executive Director of PCJF, Mara Verheyden- Willard said, 'The documents show that the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security are treating protests against the corporate and banking structure of America as potential criminal and terrorist activity.' Verheyden-Willard added, federal agencies are acting as 'a de-facto intelligence arm,' for corporations and Wall Street, a claim that is not off base.<br\/> In late 2010, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange threatened to take down an American bank. In fear that they were the ones targeted, Bank of America got together with their friends in a quest to discredit and destroy Wikileaks. In the report Spooky Business,[5] author Gary Ruskin noted the bank hired the law firm Hunton Williams to join forces with security companies Palantir Technologies, Berico Technologies, and HB Gary to devise a plan to save BoA by orchestrating 'highly unethical, and\/or illegal tactics,' to ruin the reputation of Wikileaks. Those tactics included submitting false information and calling out the errors to ruin the reputation of leaker, as well as attacking their network to expose the identities of the leakers. The plan even included a plan to destroy the career of journalist Glenn Greenwald, for the crime of supporting Wikileaks.<br\/> In emails leaked by Wikileaks, former head of HB Gary Aaron Burr noted Greenwald was a person the team needed to 'highlight,' because, 'without the support of people like him, Wikileaks would fold.' When media outlets reported on the story, Hunton Williams refused to comment at any time, the D.C powerhouse firm stayed silent in a desperate attempt to avoid responsibility. They have multi-national corporations, banks, and security firms to protect from hackers, protestors, and anyone who attacks unethical practises their clients make a sport out of. Bank of America is only one of those clients, and they are not the only corporation who attack protest.<br\/> The Spooky Business report found, 'Corporations have been linked to a wide variety of espionage tactics. The most prevalent tactic appears to be infiltration by posing a volunteer or journalist, to obtain information from a non-profit.' These activities are practiced by the likes of Monsanto, Kraft, Wal Mart, Shell go to any lengths to silence protest through blackmail, and intimidation. All in an effort to silence concerned Americans who practice freedom of speech and assembly.<br\/> In an interview from Oakland, Ruskin claimed, 'We have so little information on the outbreak of corporate espionage.' Without an Edward Snowden within the apparatus, corporations are able to 'cloak their espionage activities,' in complete secrecy. Even though Ruskin authored a report that shined a light on the practise of corporate spying, his work is only a treatment in an empty book void of pertinent information. In the eyes of Ruskin, 'You have seen no action as far as you can tell, from either Congress, or the Department of Justice regarding wrongdoing by the latest geo-corporate espionage against non profit organizations.' <br\/> When security companies hired by federal agencies, hire former federal agents from the CIA, FBI, and various police forces, the motivation to investigate these operations is non-existent. The American spy state is alive and well. As long as corporate espionage operations remain a dark secret, America's constitutional rights will slowly vanish.<br\/> [1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.scribd.com\/doc\/195106541\/Modified-Redacted-Dorsey-Combined-Emails-PD-13-1055-0357-Removed-Two-Pages-Detailing-Organizers-Home-Address\">http:\/\/www.scribd.com\/doc\/195106541\/Modified-Redacted-Dorsey-Combined-Emails-PD-13-1055-0357-Removed-Two-Pages-Detailing-Organizers-Home-Address<\/url> [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/news.cnet.com\/8301-1009_3-57571955-83\/anonymous-leaks-alleged-data-on-bofa-execs-surveillance\/\">http:\/\/news.cnet.com\/8301-1009_3-57571955-83\/anonymous-leaks-alleged-data-on-bofa-execs-surveillance\/<\/url> [3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.dsac.gov\/Pages\/index.aspx\">http:\/\/www.dsac.gov\/Pages\/index.aspx<\/url> [4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.justiceonline.org\/commentary\/fbi-files-ows.html\">http:\/\/www.justiceonline.org\/commentary\/fbi-files-ows.html<\/url> [5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.corporatepolicy.org\/2013\/11\/20\/spooky-business\/\">http:\/\/www.corporatepolicy.org\/2013\/11\/20\/spooky-business\/<\/url><\/p><p\/><\/body>","1289":"Alphabet Inc.: staged a protest at the companyThousands of Google employees walk away from desks to protest Donald Trump's immigration ban alongside co-founder and CEO","603":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">YouTube has disabled 210 channels for posting content related to the Hong Kong protests \"in a coordinated manner,\" following in the footsteps of Facebook and Twitter in restricting its arbitrary censorship to pro-China accounts.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Channels in this network behaved in a coordinated manner while uploading videos related to the ongoing protests in Hong Kong,\" Google threat analyst Shane Huntley claimed in a blog\u00a0post\u00a0on Thursday, adding that the Google team's \"discovery\" was \"consistent with recent observations and actions related to China announced by Facebook and Twitter.\"<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Translation?

The \"use of VPNs\" and \"other methods of disguise\" \u2013 widespread in the era of mass surveillance \u2013 was all the proof required to wipe the channels out of existence.<\/p><p>Twitter got the anti-China censorship ball rolling earlier this week, in perhaps the first-ever social media preemptive strike \"proactively\" deplatforming hundreds of thousands of accounts for the capital crime of \"sowing discord.\" Their crimes included \"undermining the legitimacy and political positions of the protest movement on the ground.\" One could argue that the protests themselves\u00a0are\u00a0a form of political discord, but resistance is futile when charged with such an inchoate offense.<\/p><p>None of the social media platforms have ever defined what exactly constitutes \"attempting to sow discord,\" though a common thread running through the mass deplatformings of the past year suggests it involves posting in support of a government the US doesn't like \u2013 whether Russia, Iran, Venezuela, or China.<\/p><p>The social media Ministry of Truth has become increasingly open about the irrelevance of truth in what constitutes actionable disinformation. One group of \"experts\" in the spread of disinfo online even published a paper this week explaining that true statements could constitute\u00a0disinformation\u00a0if they were arranged to serve a purpose, calling for platforms to expand their definition of \"inauthentic behavior\" to include anyone reposting information portraying the \"good guys\" in a negative light.<\/p><p>The Chinese government challenged Twitter to explain its decision to ban state-owned media from advertising, asking \"Why is it that China's official media's presentation is surely negative or wrong?\"<\/p><p>Beijing has pointed to a US role in fanning the flames of unrest, a charge that grows more plausible with every day the protests continue despite having succeeded in forcing the Hong Kong government to withdraw a bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to China. Armies of pro-protest tweeters swarm any post by\u00a0Secretary of State Mike Pompeo with pleas to intervene in their plight, even as US lawmakers threaten to rain down fire and fury should anyone harm a hair on a protester's head. And photos of the protest leaders meeting with US diplomats suggest there is certainly some \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\" at play on the other side.<\/p><p>YouTube, as a subsidiary of Google, has been exposed as even more partisan than Twitter's arbiters of truth. A whistleblower released nearly 1,000 pages of internal documentation earlier this month showing YouTube's algorithms were aimed more at shaping reality than at accurately portraying it. The platform removed Iranian state media channels as Washington ramped up tensions with Tehran in the Strait of Hormuz, and its deactivation of pro-China channels now suggests the protests - despite achieving their initially stated goal \u2013 are far from over.<\/p><p>RT<\/p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/488\/1468\/11\/156655191795.jpeg\">http:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/488\/1468\/11\/156655191795.jpeg<\/url><\/p><p><br\/><\/p><\/body>","534":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\"\/><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Aug 16, 2014 (Gates of Vienna:<url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/gatesofvienna.net\">http:\/\/gatesofvienna.net<\/url>\/ Delivered by Newstex)<br\/> Jozias van Aartsen, the mayor of The Hague, has for the time being banned all political demonstrations in Schilderswijk, the district where a Muslim mob confronted and blocked an anti-ISIS demonstration last weekend.

To what extent is the broad body of U.S. citizens sovereign, semi-sovereign, or largely powerless?'<br\/> 'The statistical research looked at public attitudes on nearly 1,800 policy issues and determined that government almost always ignores the opinions of average citizens and adopts the policy preferences of monied business interests when shaping the contours of U.S. laws.'<br\/> 'The study's findings align with recent trends, where corporate elites have aggressively pursued pro-amnesty policies despite the fact that, according to the most recent Reuters poll, 70% of Americans believe illegal immigrants 'threaten traditional U.S. beliefs and customs,' and 63% believe 'immigrants place a burden on the economy.''<br\/><br\/>Britain's 'Murky Anti-Semitic Subculture'[66]<br\/> by Samuel Westrop<br\/> Recent anti-Israel protests have been attended by thousands across Europe.

The Kurds were said to be outraged when they saw Gaza protesters waving the black Islamic flag that is often linked with ISIS.<br\/> Many Kurds in the UK are refugees from Iraq, and they often have family members still living in the country. This means they get reports about what is happening with the ISIS advance and are, as a result, deeply concerned. When they saw the black flag, they were not willing to leave it unchallenged.<br\/> Sarwat Jaf, who witness the clash between the two groups, said: 'They said they were helping the Palestinians and they waved a Palestinian flag, but after that they brought the Isis flag as well\u2026 The Kurdish people did not want that. They said that Isis are terrorists and are killing our people in Kurdistan.'<br\/> The incident was sufficiently serious to warrant the attention of five police officers and a helicopter. Two arrests were made for public order offences.<br\/> South Yorkshire Police broke up the incident, and claimed that the Kurds had mistook the black flag of Islam for the ISIS flag. There are a number of black flags used by various Muslim groups, most of which are also used by ISIS\u2026<br\/><br\/> UK: Labour and Conservatives Join Forces to Condemn BNP's Campaign Against Mosque in New Addington[78]<br\/> Political rivals have joined forces to condemn a British National Party-led campaign opposing a mosque in New Addington.<br\/> Croydon Central MP Gavin Barwell, New Addington and Fieldway councillors and Greater London Authority member Steve O'Connell issued a joint statement ahead of a meeting, hosted by the far right party, which it said 'sought to whip up fear and Islamophobia'\u2026<br\/><br\/> UK: Major Anti-ISIS Rally Planned for London, Concerns Over EDL, Islamist Attendance[79]<br\/> In the shadow of major Gaza protests in London, campaigners will tomorrow stage what they hope will be a large scale anti-ISIS demonstration in the UK capital.<br\/> Following this week's action outside Number 10 Downing Street, Britain's Kurdish community alongside counter-extremism campaigners will march from BBC Broadcasting House towards the US embassy before moving towards Marble Arch\u2026<br\/><br\/> UK: Mums Rally Behind Kingswood Daycare Nursery in Mitcham After Religious and Racial Dispute Over 'Non-Halal' Chicken Sandwich[80]<br\/> Mums have rallied behind a nursery accused of 'starving' a 5-year-old girl because the meat in her sandwich was non-halal\u2026<br\/><br\/> UK: New Gillingham Mosque to be Built on Car Park Next to Town Railway Station[81]<br\/> Plans for a large mosque were approved by Medway council this evening as police waited outside after a 'day of action' by right wing activists.<br\/> Right wing pressure group Britain First carried out a 'day of action' in the Medway towns today in protest at the mosque plans.<br\/> Activists handed out leaflets and protested with a banner stating 'No more mosques!'\u2026<br\/><br\/> UK: Nigel Farage Confirms South Thanet Candidacy[82]<br\/> UKIP leader Nigel Farage has confirmed he wants to stand in the South Thanet seat in next year's general election.<br\/> Mr Farage said he had 'thrown my hat in the ring', ending months of speculation that he was lining up the Kent constituency as his target for the 2015 contest\u2026<br\/><br\/> UK: Who's Responsible for These Anti-Semitic Attacks?

The Agranat and Winograd Commissions were convened by Israel's Knesset to investigate intelligence failures and military operational problems resulting in recommendations for corrective actions. What is apparent during the current Operation Protective Edge in Gaza is that bureaucratic bungling in Israel's intelligence and planning echelons may have contributed to the IDF casualty toll in Gaza from attacks by Hamas commandos using the terror tunnels.<br\/><br\/> Islamic Jihad: Truce Deal With Israel Next Monday[85]<br\/> Terror group says an agreement will be signed at the end of the current ceasefire, confirms Israeli concessions.<br\/> An Islamic Jihad spokesperson on Friday claimed that a truce deal with Israel will be signed as soon the current five-day ceasefire ends next Monday at midnight.<br\/> 'We expect a complete truce agreement to be signed right as the five-day ceasefire ends.

An editorial in the London-based Al-Quds Al-Arabi last month called on moderate Muslims to denounce the actions of the group formerly known as ISIS, which has killed thousands and left an estimated 1.5 million people displaced in northern Iraq.<br\/> 'All we have to do to understand the high price that Muslims pay on all levels (for such actions) is to see how Westerners snatch up (such reports on) ISIS's conquests, invasions and despicable actions, and share them on social media in order to tarnish the image of Islam,' the July 24 editorial read.<br\/><br\/> Car Bomb in Syria's Deraa Province Kills 14[87]<br\/> BEIRUT: At least 14 people were killed Friday when a car bomb exploded in front of a mosque in Deraa province of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.<br\/> The Britain-based activist group said the death toll for the bombing in the rebel-controlled town of Namar was likely to rise because of the high number of serious injuries\u2026<br\/><br\/> EU Ministers Seek Unity on Arming Iraqi Kurds[88]<br\/> (BRUSSELS) \u2014 EU ministers convene in Brussels on Friday in a rare summertime meeting to seek unanimous approval for the shipment of arms to Iraqi Kurds fighting Islamic State jihadists.<br\/> The unscheduled gathering comes after days of forceful demands by France, whose Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius criticised EU colleagues for remaining on holiday while besieged civilians were being killed in Iraq.<br\/> 'When there are people dying\u2026 you have to come back from your holidays,' Fabius said earlier this week, after writing a letter to EU foreign affairs supremo Catherine Ashton demanding an extraordinary meeting of ministers.<br\/>Italy, which currently holds the EU's rotating leadership and whose foreign minister Federica Mogherini is on the short-list to replace Ashton this year, also called for talks.<br\/> 'We're not talking about military intervention but providing support, even of a military sort, to the Kurdish government,' she said.<br\/> Defence matters are strictly the purview of member states and France and Britain have already announced they will ship weapons to Iraqi Kurds struggling to push back Islamic State fighters.<br\/><br\/> In Iraq \u2014 Children Drinking Parents Blood to Survive[89]<br\/> 'There is still a big humanitarian crisis going on \u2014 what I saw was heartbreaking,' British Kurd Taban Shoresh told Sky News.<br\/> 'We need to do something to rescue those people \u2014 30,000 people trapped on a mountain by IS in fear of extermination.

According to a report published in Reuters, the Syrian rebel group was trained in Jordan over the last two years by US government officials and military experts. If this is true, it would shed a very interesting light on what is the actual agenda of the United States government in a country where they profess to be seeking stability.<br\/> The plan appears to have been designed to train 10,000 'moderates' of Islam in the hope that they would follow American interests in the region.

And its power is beginning to have a significant impact on Israel's relations with other democracies.<br\/> Consider South Africa. Following a lopsided vote by the University of Cape Town's Student Union to boycott Israel, Jewish students fear that their own student union will be barred from operating on campus. Carla Frumer from the South African Jewish Student Union told The Times of Israel, 'If they prove we are a Zionist organization and support Israel, they can have us banned and seek to de-register us.'<br\/> In Sydney, Australia, Jewish families received a triple blow last week when Jewish children on a chartered school bus were assaulted by eight anti-Semitic drunken teenagers.<br\/> The first shock was that their children, some as young as five, were terrorized on their school bus.<br\/> The second shock was that the bus driver made an unscheduled stop to allow the anti-Semites to board the bus and harass the children.<br\/> The third shock was that after catching six of the eight assailants, the police let them out of jail the same evening.<br\/> Taken together, the incident revealed an obscene comfort level among Australian authorities with the terrorization of Jewish children. Jewish families cannot assume that their children will be protected by non-Jews, whether they are school bus drivers or the police\u2026<br\/> [1]: <url

<br\/>\u00abDiversity Oscars\u00bb turn spotlight on race<br\/>By Valerie Hamilton, dpa\u00a0\u00a0 =<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>With yet another all-white slate of nominations for this year's<br\/>Oscars, host <person><nameText>Chris Rock <\/nameText><\/person>pulled no punches in his criticism of racism<br\/>in the movie industry.<\/pre><\/p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\"><br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>Los Angeles (dpa) - Ahead of the Academy Awards this year, <person><nameText>Chris Rock<\/nameText><\/person><br\/>had a problem.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>The African American comic and actor, a prominent critic of race in<br\/>Hollywood, was contracted to host the telecast of the 88th Oscars for<br\/>the second time.\u00a0\u00a0But he found himself at the centre of a storm of<br\/>controversy after the Academy announced an all-white slate of acting<br\/>nominees, for the second year in a row.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>Social media cried foul over the perceived snub to several prominent<br\/>black artists and their films, Spike Lee and <person><nameText>Will and Jada <\/nameText><\/person>Pinkett<br\/>Smith skipped the ceremony in protest, and civil rights leaders<br\/>called for a public boycott.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>Rock said he considered quitting, too, \"but I realized they were<br\/>going to hold the Oscars anyway,\" he said. So his solution was<br\/>instead to use the broadcast - all 3.5 hours of it - to shine a light<br\/>on Hollywood's diversity problem.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>He opened Sunday's show - \"the white people's choice awards,\" as he<br\/>called it - with a question.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>\"Why are we protesting? Why this Oscars?\" Rock asked, pointing out<br\/>that there have been no black nominees \"at least 71 other times,\" in<br\/>past decades.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>\"Why? Because we had real things to protest\" back then, he said. \"We<br\/>were too busy being raped and lynched to care about who won best<br\/>cinematographer.\"<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>Despite the absence of black nominees, Hollywood's annual awards gala<br\/>could not be accused of ignoring race this year.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>From Rock's acerbic opening monologue and pointed taped segments<br\/>challenging black marginalization in cinema to his final salute that<br\/>\"black lives matter,\" race was as much the focus of the broadcast as<br\/>the films it exists to celebrate.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>\"Is Hollywood racist? You're damn right Hollywood is racist,\" Rock<br\/>said.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>Not \"burning-crosses racist,\" not \"fetch-me-some-lemonade racist,\"<br\/>but \"'sorority racist,'\" Rock joked. \"'We like you, Rhonda, but<br\/>you're not a Kappa.'\"<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>\"We want opportunities. We want the black actors to get the same<br\/>opportunities, that's it,\" he added.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences President Cheryl Boone<br\/>Isaacs took the stage as well, calling on Hollywood to act to create<br\/>an inclusive industry.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>\"Our audiences are global and rich in diversity, and every facet of<br\/>our industry should be as well,\" she said.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>The public outcry over the nominations in January moved the Academy<br\/>to overhaul its voting and membership rules, and pledge to double<br\/>women and non-white membership by 2020.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>But rather than quelling the debate, it expanded it to include<br\/>diversity and clout in the industry as a whole. Accustomed to framing<br\/>society's stories, Hollywood has itself now become a reluctant<br\/>parable for the country's entrenched struggles with race.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>With tongue in cheek, Rock promised to use the ceremony to shine a<br\/>light. \"Things are going to be a little different\" this year, he<br\/>promised, starting with a segment traditionally devoted to film<br\/>artists who died in the past year.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>\"This year the in memoriam package is just going to be black people<br\/>that was shot by the cops on their way to the movies,\" Rock said.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>It was not, but much of the rest of the ceremony focused on tensions<br\/>over diversity.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>A taped segment about creating opportunities for black actors<br\/>satirized the year's top films, and the system that made them.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>Oscar winner Whoopi Goldberg played a cynical janitor alongside<br\/>Jennifer Lawrence's mop entrepreneur in Joy. African American comic<br\/>Leslie Jones reprised The Revenant's famous bear attack scene - as<br\/>the bear - telling Leonardo DiCaprio he should have called her back<br\/>for a role.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>And Rock appeared in Matt Damon's space suit as the stranded<br\/>astronaut in The Martian, only to have white NASA officials tell him<br\/>they won't spend their \"white dollars\" to bring him home.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>A mock tribute to Black History Month - February in the United States<br\/>- set up what was clearly a tribute to Will Smith, an African<br\/>American actor passed over for a nomination this year. The joke's<br\/>punchline? At the end, the tribute celebrated a white actor, Jack<br\/>Black.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>Rock also reprised a segment from his 2005 Oscars show, in which he<br\/>interviewed black movie-goers in a historically black neighbourhood<br\/>about the year's nominees.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>Few had heard of the year's white Oscar nominees, but they all knew<br\/>the African American themed films that didn't make the cut.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>But the skit turned poignant, when Rock gave interviewees an Oscar<br\/>statuette to hold, and asked for their acceptance speeches.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>\"This should not just be white - it should be Asian, Hispanic,<br\/>there's talent out there of all races,\" said one man.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>A woman said African Americans should get more Oscars because \"they<br\/>deserve it and work hard for it just like anybody else.\"<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>\"How about that, America?\" she said.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0Feb 2916 0750 GMT  <\/pre><\/p><\/body>","484":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">The Westboro Baptist Church has decided to target tech companies with protests on its \"God hates the media\" tour.<\/p><p>The group, known for picketing funerals of soldiers and anti-gay protests, is now moving to stop the spread of \"wicked political propaganda\" through social media sites.

But the reality is that even with bumps and glitches, streaming and other means of distribution weaken their one-time dominance.<\/p><p>It is also a given that smaller networks have become more vulnerable, which is why media conglomerates seek to leverage their most desirable channels to ensure carriage of lesser ones, lumped together under the umbrellas of Disney, NBC Universal, Viacom, Fox and Discovery.<\/p><p>Those companies are simultaneously hedging their digital bets, seeking to ensure distribution for their content. The takeaway from this week, though, was that a mix of unforeseen events and social media can unexpectedly thrust lower-profile channels into the spotlight.

The nature of communism is a lie,\" he said.<\/p><p>\"For many years now they have slandered not only me, but all those who fight for our rights, for the truth,\" he said.<\/p><p>On the documentary's accusation of attempting to overthrow the government, both Nguyen and Thuy denied they were in any position to pose a threat.<\/p><p>\"They know well that we were allowed to protest at that time, so this is slander.

That's why they only report the news in a way that supports the Communist Party, not the people,\" he said.<\/p><p>Thoi Bao landed in hot water after reporting on the 2017 kidnapping of ex-oil executive Trinh Xuan Thanh as he sought asylum in Germany. Trinh ended up jailed for life in Vietnam on corruption charges.<\/p><p>\"Since [that report] we've made a point to verify our sources, especially if we're reporting on political, social, and cultural issues,\" said Le, adding, \"People can verify the sources on the internet.\"<\/p><p>\"The information we give is very different from what other outlets give to the people in this country, and we include topics about overseas Vietnamese.

This means that you, the reader, need to learn to differentiate between an independent, well-researched point of view, and an embedded public relations plug-whether it is on television, in your favourite newspaper or on social media. Here is a primer culled from the FT report.<\/p><p>Brand Journalism: A new form of reporting is one that's produced by companies and tailored to project a company's point of view. Companies hire professional journalists to produce these polished reports, so that the ordinary reader is unable to see them as PR plugs.<\/p><p>FT cites the example of oil major Chevron, which runs a hyper-local digital news brand at Richmond, California (where it is headquartered). While it publishes mainly feel-good news, it also helps gloss over allegations about environmental damage. In India, Reliance Industries has hired a team of senior journalists to 'manage' its social media image, publish videos and books, to project its point of view.<\/p><p>Churnalism: This is the process where PR agencies create slickly produced content that is released directly to people through social media, YouTube, etc, as news. Interestingly, loss-making mainstream media is often happy to 'embed' these videos and photographs in their reports, making it a win-win for corporate PR.<\/p><p>The report cites the examples of Apple's iPhone6 launch (fully choreographed with live blogging, perfectly lit images and gushing endorsements from celebrities being re-tweeted) and Microsoft introducing Indian-born CEO Satya Nadella to the media in a similar manner. The head of General Motors recorded an emotive YouTube video of her reaction to faulty ignition leading to fatal crashes prior to appearing before the US Congress hearing.<\/p><p>Native Advertising a.k.a Paid News: Advertisements made to look like a genuine news story or video where the reader cannot know the difference.

One of the biggest labor unions of the country, the Teamsters are calling for a giant protest tomorrow. The following statement was just sent by activists to ValueWalk. See the text below.Verizon Workers Verizon Workers protestOn April 13, 2016 I declared that the Teamsters stand united with the Communications Workers of American and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers' strike against Verizon. As the strike continues into its fourth week, Verizon workers are determined to fight for as long as it takes to protect good jobs for themselves and those who follow. Tomorrow, May 5, Verizon strikers will be picketing at Verizon storefronts across the country, letting the company know that they're not backing down. Teamster Local Unions and members are urged to support our union brothers and sisters at Verizon in the following ways: Participate in the Day of Action tomorrow, Thursday, May 5, by joining pickets at Verizon storefronts across the country.[1] Promote the Day of Action through your social media platforms.

We have our own battles with corporate giants like US Foods where multiple Teamster Local Unions are on Unfair Labor Practice strikes, and at a Supervalu-owned distributor that services Kroger stores in Colorado. By having a strong Teamster presence supporting CWA and IBEW and helping those unions win their battles, we will help our union win current and future battles against these corporate giants.

On June 26th through the 29th, she traveled to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. She met with leaders with from all sectors of Central American society to advance our regional partnership for a more secure and prosperous Central America.

Thank you.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: All right. Thank you, Jean, and good afternoon. Its nice to see everybody again. I am relatively recently back from Central America, and I wanted to start off talking a little bit about that, about the trip, and about some of the things I saw and put it in a little bit of context, and then we can open it up to whatever everyone would like to talk about.<\/p><p>So let me start off saying that it had been about a year and a half since I had been to Central America, and so it seemed like a good idea to get back there. Obviously, this is a big focus for us, especially in our security programs, and the Central American Regional Security Program is obviously an integral part of all four of our interlocking security citizen security initiatives: the Merida Initiative in Mexico, Central American Regional Security Initiative, the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, and the Colombia Strategic Development Initiative. So it was important for me to get back to talking with some of our Central American partners.<\/p><p>I think overall one of the things that you see in Central America, which is a hallmark of what were doing around the hemisphere, really is the two areas in particular, one, that the engagement on security issues goes well beyond law enforcement and just the police or military side of security. When we talk about working with partners in the hemisphere on citizen security issues, were talking about an integrated approach to citizen security that spans the gamut, and Im going to talk about that again in a minute.<\/p><p>But the other thing I wanted to mention was it was very important to me that I highlight something that the Secretary has talked about a great deal, Secretary Clinton, which is the importance of civil society. One of the things the Secretary has said she said it at the Summit of the Americas in talking with the civil society forum, but she has repeated it since is that for us our foreign policy really does have three legs in this stool. And those legs are government and we obviously undertake a lot of government-to-government interaction the private sector and the business community, and civil society writ large. And I felt that I had had a pretty good opportunity over the last year or so to interact with governmental counterparts, and obviously I was going to do some of that on this trip, but that it was most important for me to make sure that I touch base with civil society activists because that is the sense that you cant really get in Washington. That is the value added of traveling. So that was an emphasis of the trip.<\/p><p>Since 2008, I think most of you know, the Central American Regional Security Initiative we have appropriated and disbursed close to $500 million of assistance in Central America, with the considerable amount of our focus on the three northern triangle countries: El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, which were the three that I visited. Those span the range of this integrated approach, as I mentioned, which really does run from police and security, law enforcement activity, to prosecutors, judges, public defenders, working with judicial systems, alternative dispute resolution, and onto efforts that were making in communities to strengthen communities to withstand the impact of transnational crime. And thats why over 90 percent of our assistance, bilateral assistance in Central America, is focused on core development issues health, education, issues like support for civil society and economic growth.<\/p><p>So I traveled to the three countries in that order, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. And two of the things that I think were most exciting for me were events that I was able to hold focusing on education and youth. In El Salvador, I was privileged to hand out 49 micro scholarships as part of our SEMILLA or SEED program. This has been in effect for many years, but weve amplified it more recently. The recipients were 50 percent female and all students that came from rural areas, students who might otherwise never have had an opportunity to go to the United States and study. And what was just as exciting as meeting the students who are going to study education, healthcare, small business development what was just as exciting was meeting their families, people who had traveled pretty long distances to be there for this celebration of their childrens success, and I thought that was terrific. We also had the privilege of having one of the alumni of the program with us who is a two-term mayor in La Union, of a community in La Union, and former governor, who was a participant in this SEED program when he was in high school. They will be studying at community colleges across the United States.<\/p><p>In Guatemala, I had the opportunity to go to Coban and to visit with students in our Access English program. What some folks may not know is that the Access English program in Guatemala is the largest in the hemisphere with 1,400 students, over 700 alumni, which is a little bit surprising, I think, to many people. But these kids were just remarkable. They are incredible students of English. They were very proud of what they had done. A number of the advanced students were serving as translators and interpreters for a U.S.-Guatemalan military humanitarian exercise that was underway called Beyond the Horizon, which I also visited. And they are serving with the medics, translating not from Spanish to English but from Kiche to English. And so they were just performing these invaluable services as a result of being able to take these classes in English for a number of months. And they were just remarkable and very enthusiastic about their work. So those were two of the things that I did.<\/p><p>In Guatemala, El Salvador, and in Honduras I also met with groups of civil society, human rights, nongovernmental organizations, those working in labor, working on legal reforms. And the group that I met with that was the largest was in El Salvador, but in Guatemala and Honduras I also got a very good representation of civil society. In Honduras, that included meeting with leaders of the Alliance for Peace and Justice, which is about a three-month-old civil society consortium, which I was very impressed with, impressed with their work and impressed with their enthusiasm, including Julieta Castellanos, the rector of the University in Honduras whose son was tragically killed last year.<\/p><p>In all three places, I think one of the things that left me optimistic was the fact that there were such vibrant civil society organizations engaged, doing their own work, working in communities, gathering their own statistics, challenging the government on occasion, but also working with them to try and create safer communities.<\/p><p>The other thing that impressed me was we know from statistics that communities in which we work with municipal governments, especially USAIDs programs on prevention and on economic opportunity, those communities have seen marked decreases in crime. But one of the things that impressed me the most in El Salvador was so have communities in which we are not necessarily working, but community leaders themselves are working to organize some of those same efforts. And so it really underscored the belief that you cannot fight crime without the engagement and involvement of the community and without creating some opportunities, especially for young people.<\/p><p>The other things, I had meetings in all three countries, obviously, with government leaders. In Honduras, there was a SICA meeting that was taking place, and that was the reason part of the reason that I was there. It was very exciting for me to be there for the first time as a formal observer to SICA, since the U.S. and I signed those papers a couple of months ago. The SICA meeting, as you may know, had a little bit of turbulence in one of the agreements that was being signed within SICA with Panama, but it really went very well in the end. We were able to make the statement about the importance of regional efforts and that no country can do this alone. Our programs are premised on regional cooperation to combat transnational crime.<\/p><p>But the other thing I thought was very exciting was that the SICA countries were able to sign the agreement with the EU, which was there to do so, which reinforces, I think, those of us who were members of the Friends of Central America group, remaining engaged and working together to coordinate our assistance in that part of the world.<\/p><p>So I left Central America, I think, frankly, slightly more optimistic than Ive been in a while. I think this is a very long, hard slog that is going to take quite a while, because fundamentally, the efforts against transnational crime can only be combated by stronger democratic institutions, institutions like the police and military, institutions like the judiciary, institutions like the fiscales (ph), institutions in communities. And so that is a long-term project and not one that were going to see turn around immediately. But I think people are starting to know what works and starting to replicate it, and I also think weve seen very important movement forward over the last year or two by governments to create the structures and the legal frameworks, the policy agenda that makes success possible, which is certainly a very important first step. There is still a ways to go.<\/p><p>But I also came back very encouraged by what were doing with young people. The best part of my job and I said this while I was there the best part of my job is the engagement with young people on educational issues, because that it sounds like sort of kumbaya and clich, but that actually is the way we ensure that things get better in the future. So I was very encouraged by that.<\/p><p>And I will leave you finally with a reiteration of the importance of institutions. I was listening to Fernando Henrique Cardoso over the last two days and last night when he won the Kluge Prize at the Library of Congress, which is a $1 million prize for his academic study of humanity. And he talked about a phrase that we have seen elsewhere, but I really like it in this context, which is the infrastructure of hope. And in the end, the infrastructure of hope, what it means is democratic institutions that can withstand corruption, that can withstand transnational crime, that can withstand abuse, and thats what were trying to construct with our partners in Central America. So let me stop there and open things up.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. So first question, well go right here. Just wait for the microphone and state your name and<\/p><p>QUESTION: Jesus Esquivel from Proceso Magazine. Roberta, I have two questions for you one on Central America and the other on Mexico. The President-elect of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, has said hes going to change the strategy in the war on drugs, especially with the relation of the United States. He wants to demilitarize the strategy, and second, he says hes going to concentrate more on the issue of security for the Mexican people. And he says the measure of success is not on the number of confiscation of drugs and the arrest of the capos in Mexico.<\/p><p>My question to in this regard is: Is the U.S. Government worried about it? You know very well the issue of narcotics in Mexico, and that will probably increase the number of drugs crossing the border if hes going to do exactly what hes saying. Are you guys worried about it? I know youre going to say, We are ready to work with him, but the State Department already said that.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Youre answering your own question, Jesus. (Laughter.)<\/p><p>QUESTION: Well, but Roberta, we need more<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Its a fair question.<\/p><p>QUESTION: We need more specific answer to that. And the second is on Central America. He also said that one of his priorities will be working with Central America and trying to include Brazil on that. And he says the Merida Initiative is not working as it was planned on Central America. So he says he want to have more hemisphere approach to the problem of the security and international crime in Central America. Whats your position on that?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Okay. Thanks. I appreciate that, and let me start with the first question. Im not going to surprise you. Im not worried. And part of the reason Im not worried is because I think weve certainly watched and listened to everything that Enrique Pena Nieto has said before the election and now since the election, and youre right, Im going to say that we look forward to working with him, which we do.<\/p><p>But its also true that I have seen nothing in anything he has said that gives me cause for concern. The notion that somebody wants to re-look at a strategy and possibly make changes I think is not only to be expected but a healthy thing. Strategies get put into place to respond to a moment in time and hopefully move you forward, right, in the fight against transnational organized crime. But they also have to be adaptable. They have to shift and change, because we know that the criminal organizations shift and change.<\/p><p>We also know, and I would say much more broadly, that the notion that you want to go from whats your measure of success is it drugs interdicted, is it rates of homicide or violence I have always said, and I think we have said from the beginning with the Merida Initiative, that there are many multiple metrics that you can use and that clearly the level of violence in Mexico is unacceptable to Mexicans and it should be unacceptable to all of us. And so the fact that that is an important metric for the President-elect, I think is entirely logical. I dont think it necessarily means there will be less drugs interdicted. I dont know exactly what changes to the strategy the new President may make and what those changes what effect those changes will have on the cartels. I think well have to wait and see. But its a very productive conversation to have. And it is clearly one of the things you hear from all over the region, is that the level of violence is too high, that that has to go down. Its why we have seen changes in the way that people approach this problem. Its why you see changes like the truce that was brokered in El Salvador with the gangs. There is a real desire to lower that level of violence that is entirely understandable.<\/p><p>But I would also say that when you talk about Central America and where Mexico may shift or emphasize engagement with Central America, I think thats incredibly encouraging. I think thats exactly the right message, which is that we all have to be working better together, that Mexico has an enormous amount to contribute even while it is confronting these problems at home, but that there are others in the hemisphere who have something that they can bring to the table to support efforts in Central America. Weve seen that already, quite frankly, very actively and very positively with Colombia, in Central America, and with Chile, already engaging with those countries on ways of doing business and ways of combating corruption and criminal activity that have been successful and can be modeled or replicated or adjusted for Central America.<\/p><p>The notion of whether Brazil can also play a role on that, I think is a very positive conversation to have. I think certainly the Brazilians have capabilities and have experience that can be useful, and we think the more partners from within the hemisphere that can help in Central America, the better.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. For our next question, well go in the front here to Sonia.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi. Thank you. My name is Sonia Schott. I am with Globovision, Venezuela. Heavyweight Republicans have criticized the politics towards the political strategy towards Venezuela. I was wondering if you have any comments on that, if you agreed on that, because it seems to be that the bilateral relations are in a freeze point. It is because the electoral year, not only here but in Venezuela, and that makes me go to my second question. You have repeatedly asked for a transparent process, electoral process in Venezuela. What did that mean? What will need to happen in Venezuela in order for you to recognize it was a transparent electoral process? Does it has to do with the electoral missions? Thank you.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thank you. I appreciate that. I think it probably will not surprise you that I disagree with the notion that we do not have a good policy on Venezuela. I think the thing about our policy on Venezuela is and I would argue that, yes, we are both in electoral years; yes, electoral years in every country in the world make international relations more complicated because domestic politics takes precedence in many ways. But I would argue to you that the relationship that we have with Venezuela, if indeed its frozen and I dont disagree that it is not as productive as it could be right now but that that started before certainly before our electoral calendar really picked up, and it was independent of that. And frankly, it is disappointing to us because we are willing to and happy to engage on practical issues where we can cooperate or we may see things the same way. But we have not had that reciprocated from the Venezuelan Government, and thats unfortunate.<\/p><p>We also obviously would like to be able to cooperate on issues of regional importance, but that has not been possible because the Venezuelan Government has not seemed eager to do that, to work with us, as opposed to speaking, in the rhetorical sense certainly, against some of the United States initiatives and some of our efforts. So that is disappointing to us. And we remain ready to have that more productive relationship, but not willing to do anything more than extend that hand. And if it is not reciprocated, then we arent willing to take that any further. Its just not productive.<\/p><p>Let me also say, though, that on the elections, I think there are very clear ways in which Venezuela can ensure that the international community at large not just the United States, which frankly is not necessarily the arbiter here, it is the international community at large can have confidence in the results. And the way to do that is to welcome in observers. And so we hope that that will be the case, that Venezuela will welcome in observers, whether from the EU or the OAS. I think that would make a very large difference in the confidence that those in the international community have in the results.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. For our next question, well go to New York.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Yes. Hello. I am Ana Baron from Clarin of Argentina. Thank you very much for this press conference. I have two questions on Argentina. First of all, while we know that trade restrictions was one of the subjects you discussed on your last trip to Argentina, so I wanted to know since then there was the United States complaint in the WTO. Now Argentina, some time ago some minutes ago, hours ago has presented a complaint against the lemons and meat restrictions in U.S. market. So I wanted to know if we are assisting to a little trade war between the two countries.<\/p><p>And second, I have a question of narco-trafficking. You were talking a lot about narco-trafficking in Central America. Since the plane the military plane was detained in Ezeiza, it seems that the cooperation between the two countries has diminished significantly. I wanted to know if this is a subject that worries and if you see some prospective of ameliorating the relationship at this on this subject.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thank you. I think on the first point, on the trade issues, it certainly wasnt the central part central component of my visit there. Im not a trade expert for the U.S. Government. But I certainly did have conversations, and we continue, obviously, as you note, in these movements more recently to continue to have conversations with Argentina about concerns that we have, whether on specific trade issues or on import restrictions and other things that U.S. companies are finding difficult in Argentina. We continue again to look for a way that we can cooperate on these issues, but we do think that there are international rules and regulations that we all have to abide by. And its one of the reasons why the WTO is there, why organizations like ICSID or SIAVE (ph)*, the organization to arbitrate financial disputes. What we believe in is a rules-based system in which folks actually comply with the rules, which we will do when the decisions go against us and we hope other countries will do when decisions go against them.<\/p><p>So were still trying to work through all of these issues, but I will say that there is a desire on both parties sides, I think certainly speaking for the United States Government to try and resolve those issues in as productive a way as we can, and to try and recognize that we have lots of other components of a bilateral relationship that can move ahead. And we want to be sure that while we work on those economic, commercial, or trade problems that we may have in the relationship, they do not, frankly, bleed into other areas of the relationship where we have a more positive engagement and we are able to move forward.<\/p><p>When I was in Argentina in February, two of the things that I worked on and that I think that Im particularly excited about are moving forward on educational exchanges, which, frankly, are pretty low between Argentina and the United States. I think theres head room there, room to grow.<\/p><p>And so weve moved forward with an agreement with the Argentine Government on some additional scholarships and pushing up those numbers. And I had a meeting with 13 rectors of universities that was very productive, as well as with the Minister of Education. But we also signed a sister parks agreement for our national parks, which I think is also very important, and was very impressed by the Argentine presentation on that.<\/p><p>In following up on that, we now have we had the NASA administrator who went to Argentina. And we have Tecnopolis, I think opening this week perhaps in Argentina, with an exhibit from the United States. So theres lots of other areas in which we can cooperate.<\/p><p>Getting to your second question because I think it relates, obviously cooperating on narcotics is one of those areas where I think that we should still be able to work together regardless of other problems. And its also true that cooperation on security issues, in particular narcotics\/counternarcotics efforts, was clearly set back by the incident last year. I am pretty optimistic that were going to be able to move ahead on a cooperative agenda on narcotics issues. I think there is a desire on the part of the Argentine Government to move ahead on that, and I certainly will confirm that there is a strong desire on our part.<\/p><p>So Im more optimistic probably even than I was when I was in Argentina four or five months ago that we can move ahead on that productively.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Great. For our next question well go in the front right here.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Jacobson. This is Tomas Guevara, the editor of El Diario de Hoy, Salvador. When you visited recently El Salvador, the countrys in a serious political crisis now. What do you think about that situation between the conflict with the national assembly, with the supreme court, and how it can impact the relationship with the U.S.?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I think its an incredibly important question, and I was struck obviously by that dispute between the assembly and the court when I was in El Salvador. And I obviously spoke with a lot of people about it to learn as much as I could, to hear from folks on the ground what they saw as the prospects for resolution. And this was I was there just before July 1. Now weve passed that July 1 date, and so in some respects the issue has gotten even more acute.<\/p><p>And I would say this does concern us very greatly. This is clearly something that Salvadorans have to resolve, that we have said clearly, both I have said it in El Salvador but our Ambassador and we were all thrilled to have Mari Carmen Aponte back in San Salvador as our Ambassador has said publicly that we really do urge in the strongest terms possible that the two sides of this dispute really try and come together and resolve it. And I think thats important. It is a Salvadoran dispute to resolve; it is not ours to opine on how it gets resolved. We would just like to see it resolved.<\/p><p>But I will say that there are some issues that are important to us that engage the court or the national assembly, and those things are being, frankly, held up by this dispute. The question of extraditions, which there are a number of extraditions pending, and we think its important that extraditions be part of not the only available tool but part of the tool kit that governments be able to use to fight transnational crime. Those may not move ahead while this dispute simmers.<\/p><p>There is discussion in El Salvador, I certainly heard from all sides, of new investment laws and things that need to move ahead in the national assembly, which would be very important and very, I think, beneficial for the Partnership for Growth effort that were undertaking with El Salvador and the efforts that were trying to make to move ahead on economic development. If those things get slowed down by this dispute, then thats a problem that really affects more than just El Salvador, unfortunately.<\/p><p>QUESTION: A follow-up?<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Sure. A follow-up.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi. This is Luis Alonso. Are you concerned with the stability of the President Funes Government? Because of this dispute, is there a state of rule of law in danger by this dispute?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I confess to you, I have seen lots of breathless commentary about this. And theres no doubt in my mind that this is a serious concern and a serious problem that needs to be worked out, but I have absolutely no concerns about the stability of the Funes Government and its sort of democracy surviving in El Salvador. This is a dispute between two branches of government. I have every confidence that Salvadorans from the various branches of government will resolve this is an amicable and legal and constitutional way, and that overall the democratic health of El Salvador will not suffer for it.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. The next question well go here and then to Denise after.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Santiago Tavara from Notimex. Do you have any update on the in Honduras the recent incidents, two incidents that involved DEA agents? And about the first incident, I think Spokesperson Victoria Nuland told us that she would release a report in the next weeks. I dont know if you have a date. And also, the second question is on Peru regarding human rights abuses reported against people who are protesting against gold mine<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Conga.<\/p><p>QUESTION: -- a proposed mine in Peru from the U.S.-based Newmont Mining Corporation. I dont know if you have any reaction.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Well, let me start on Honduras. Obviously, weve been in engaged with in support of the Honduran Government in operations against narcotics trafficking in northern Honduras, coastal Honduras, in the last number of months. In those operations, over two and a half tons of cocaine was seized in two-plus just over two months, which is an extraordinary record. I want to say clearly from the outset that in the first incident and Im not sure which first or second were talking about, but May 11th, in which it would appear from the reports that weve seen certainly from the preliminary reports that four people were killed. And that is never what you want to happen, and we regret that greatly. That was an incident in which it was not the DEA but Hondurans who were firing guns and fired upon.<\/p><p>But in all of these incidents, I think we have to wait until the investigations and the reviews are concluded. What we will do as things proceed is we will obviously be reviewing with our Honduran counterparts exactly what the operations how they worked, what worked well, what didnt work well, how can we avoid, obviously, any deaths in the future.<\/p><p>And I will also say that in the second two incidents, which were ones in which DEA did unfortunately the DEA agents did unfortunately kill those who were trafficking drugs, we do expect, frankly, that those actually doing the trafficking will resist losing their cargo and being arrested. And unfortunately, it is a very dangerous game. What we want to try and ensure with our Honduran partners is that nobody who is not involved in narco-trafficking is wounded or killed as a consequence of these operations.<\/p><p>But I think that it does reinforce the importance of that area physically, geographically, in terms of the root of cocaine up north towards the United States. And we have seen lots of indications polls taken in Honduras of support for our continued engagement, and the government has made clear that they would like the United States to remain engaged in that support and training role.<\/p><p>The second question was on Peru and reports of human rights abuses to those protesting. Its the Conga Mine, I assume. And to be honest with you, Ive seen some of the press reports, but I dont have any independent information on that. Obviously, its always worrisome when you have a situation in which there is violence, in which protest is not carried out peacefully. And what we would like to see and obviously in support of the Peruvian Government, its not a role for us is a resolution to the very difficult situation that has emerged between the community and the mining company. And I think the Peruvian Government is trying to resolve that as best they can.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Im Denise Chrispim Marim from O Estado de Sao Paolo, Brazil. Thank you very much for this opportunity. We were waiting for a long time for this.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Im sorry. (Laughter.)<\/p><p>QUESTION: Well, I wonder (inaudible) and I wanted to ask you what is exactly the position of United States in the case of the crisis in Paraguay, particularly if you how is your assessment on the sanctions that has already been imposed against Paraguay by regional organizations? And how could be the best approach of OAS in this case?<\/p><p>Secondly, if you dont mind<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: That was all the first? Wasnt that like three parts?<\/p><p>QUESTION: No, it is you know that there is a lot of talks and speculations on a meeting between military American militarys and Paraguayan officials in Asuncion last days. And there is some speculations on the interest of America to build a military base in Paraguay. I wonder to know if you are aware about this information and if it is really a desire of United States.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Okay, let me start out with that second part, because I want to be very, very clear about this. I have no information about U.S. military meeting with Paraguayan counterparts or officials in recent days. So Im not sure what thats referring to.<\/p><p>We have no desire no desire, let me be clear about this to do anything in Paraguay that isnt either requested by the Paraguayan Government or an event, an occasion, a training, an engagement that is a partnership with Paraguay. And we have no interest in promoting a base or military presence in Paraguay separate or apart from sort of our normal interaction with the Paraguayans on counternarcotics issues, on training issues, on counterterrorism. We have engaged in that kind of cooperation very transparently for years, and we hope to continue to do that. That is very different than this notion of building bases, which I really want to dispel, because it does keep coming up, which I find somewhat bizarre.<\/p><p>The other thing I want to be clear about is that we are not only transparent about what our interests and our opportunities or engagement is with the Paraguayans to the public, to our own officials, to the Congress, but to anybody else in the region whos interested. And obviously weve had conversations with our Brazilian counterparts on what each of us are doing cooperatively with Paraguay, and so that there will never be surprises in that area.<\/p><p>On the crisis in Paraguay, I think one of the things that I think is important is the report of the OAS was presented to the Permanent Council yesterday, I guess, and we were obviously very pleased to be part of that mission. The mission was made up of the U.S., Mexican, Canadian, Haitian, and Honduran ambassadors to the OAS plus the Secretary General and I think one or two of his staff. I think that that mission really got a huge spectrum of opinions while they were there all of the branches of government, President Lugo and members of his cabinet, and so meeting with President Franco and folks from his cabinet and other organizations. So I think that was a very, very important step for the OAS to take because I do think that there were conversations that needed to take place about why things happened the way they did and what justification there was for things that hadnt really taken place. So I think that that was a very important first step, and we strongly support the Secretary General in that mission. That was certainly clear by our sending our ambassador. And we continue to support his efforts and think the report is really quite well done.<\/p><p>As we look forward because I think that what we really want to do is focus on the future and what assistance Paraguay may ask for and need from the OAS in terms of preparations for elections, dialogue on issues that are still of concern and creating tension, moving ahead to ensure that in this transition period, Paraguay gets ready for exemplary elections in April of 2013. And I think in that respect, we have an enormous amount in common with all of our regional partners who I think also want to look ahead and cooperate in helping Paraguay get to that point.<\/p><p>In terms of what sub-regional organizations may have done, sanctions or suspensions, I think thats for them to comment on. Weve been very comfortable with where the OAS is on this, and we think its an excellent forum for continued engagement.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Follow-up? (Laughter.)<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Well go to the follow-up and then to your question or is it a follow-up as well?<\/p><p>QUESTION: No, its a follow-up, but about another issue. So we can follow up this one.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. (Laughter.) So you pick.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Rock, paper, scissor.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi. Yes. Youve said that the report by the Secretary General of the OAS was quite well done. I wanted to know what your assessment is, what your opinion is, on his concrete proposals to send a mission to Paraguay until the elections, and also if you think that, as he said, that its not a constructive step to suspend Paraguay from the organization.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Name your media organization?<\/p><p>QUESTION: Its EFE.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I will give you the short answer to that as yes on both questions. The only thing I would add is I think the report is very well done. I think the notion of sending a mission, sending technical experts and that could change. It depends on what Paraguayans feel they need or what the skills are that is needed at the time. And as you get closer to election, different kinds of skills are needed. But I think the notion of having the OAS remain engaged with a mission in Paraguay is a very good one, a very positive one that I think would be helpful I believe and I hope for Paraguay and for all of the rest of us trying to sort of grapple with the issue. And I think that hes right, that at this point there really doesnt appear to be a reason to suspend Paraguay from the OAS.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: So now to your follow-up question.<\/p><p>QUESTION: So thank you for doing this. I am Silvia Pisani from La Nacion in Argentina. Also, so first, I would like to ask you a very specific follow-up in the first question about Argentina, and then I will jump into another line. But the follow up is: Also, I saw some concern in the United States about a specific point of the currency exchange policy in Argentina, regarding the possibility of buying dollars. And this was affecting the American enterprises to their imports because they cant buy the dollars that they need to import.<\/p><p>And also, its beginning to now, its beginning to generate some fear in the population of the possibility of traveling abroad. So I would like to ask you if you still have those concerns and if you specifically raised them to the Argentinean Government, and if that is the case, if you received any answer about that. Thats the first point.<\/p><p>And jumping in another line, I would like to ask you: I have been seeing in the Congress particularly some concern about the freedom of expression and the freedom of press in Argentina. I would like to ask your opinion about that. Thank you.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Okay. Thank you. What I can tell you in terms of the currency issue or the ability of, in particular, U.S. businesses to operate and be able to get currency out of the country, for example, which is one of the things I heard a great deal about when I was in Argentina in February, one of the difficulties that some of our companies are having is that for many of them, it may not be that difficult because theyre not they dont operate with huge amounts of cash. For certain sectors and I think you can probably figure out which ones; it may be airlines, it may be others but for certain sectors who get a lot of revenue in cash, if you will, they have difficulties. And some of these restrictions were making things difficult for them. And so what we had asked at the time was that the Government of Argentina look at the impact of some of these restrictions, which are very broad, on particular sectors which maybe have more acute difficulty with them. And so thats a continuing discussion that were having with the Argentine Government.<\/p><p>On freedom of expression, I guess I should say: We have talked a lot about this over the last year or so. Weve talked about our concerns for journalists in the hemisphere all of you, every day, know this for your brothers and sisters working in countries throughout the hemisphere, we see with a great deal of, I think the word is just sadness and anguish, when international organizations put out statements about this region being the most dangerous for journalists. I mean, that is really sometimes shocking to us. And that danger, obviously, has come from different quarters. And its come ferociously from organized crime, frankly. But there have been other threats to journalists work not to their lives, let me be clear, but to their work and to the freedom of expression that has been mounted by governments. Whether its lawsuits, whether it is withdrawal of revenue or advertisement, whether it is shutting things down, there are threats that confront journalists. And that it seems to us really critically important as part of democracy in the hemisphere. A free press is not optional. Its an integral part of democracy in the hemisphere.<\/p><p>Now, I think you would probably agree that in Argentina we certainly could not say that there is not an opposing view in the press to that of the government. There is certainly a healthy, open, exchange in the press. But I do think its important that we continue to press to ensure that governments understand that you really dont want to start down the slippery slope of trying to reduce the amount of freedom and ability to get their message out, the news out, the information out, because it can be a slippery slope, and thats very, very frightening for all of us.<\/p><p>I should say that I think there are lots of new ways of getting information, and so when people talk about press freedom and media ownership in the hemisphere as being too concentrated or its only one view of the situation in a particular country, it seems to us that the answer to that is essentially further democratization of media and press, which becomes easier in our digital and social media age, not a narrowing of that voice.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. Well go to Jose and then in the front here.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. Thank you for doing this really. Jose Diaz-Briseno with Reforma from Mexico. When talking about the understandable, well, a concern in Mexico to lower the violence, specifically the homicide rate, you mentioned the truce of murders in El Salvador. Do you think thats a model that could be feasible and desirable in Mexico between the cartels?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I think that every case is different. And I think that truces have to be seen and this is what I have certainly heard from experts on this subject, and I am not one of them. I will preface with that. But I have certainly heard from experts on this that the one thing you have to be sure of is that truces ceasefires, as theyre often called in the United States; ceasefire Chicago, Boston has tried some of these theyre never a permanent answer, right? So they are at best, even where they work and they dont always work they are at best a temporary measure while you put into place more structural and institutional changes to reduce either violence or drug trafficking or homicide or whatever or gang activity.<\/p><p>And so I think one of the things that we need to be a little bit careful of is the notion that a truce is what we all continue to look for, sort of the magic bullet, the single thing you can do that will solve this problem. And I think some of this the structure of organized crime and narcotics trafficking I think is significantly different than gang activity. And so I think both the multiplicity of players and the trade that theyre in make it much more complicated and much less likely that is a productive tool in that particular setting. But I think thats something that obviously people look at all the time, both academics and practitioners.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi, again. Just to going back to Paraguay, just want to make sure that the assessment on whether or not the impeachment of President Lugo is a coup detat has been finished. Have you guys reached a conclusion, like the OAS expressed yesterday, or youre still assessing the --<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Well, I think what I would say is that the OAS and what the Secretary General set out in his report makes a lot of sense to us. The Secretary General talked about concerns over the rapidity or the speed of the process. We have expressed those concerns publicly. But he also talked about the constitution in Paraguay and what it provides for. And so he is striking that balance between a process that may have seemed too rapid but also is set out in their constitution. And so I think the most important thing we support his report, and the most important thing at this point is to look for constructive ways moving forward to engage with the Paraguayans, including with the Franco government, to get to the elections next year.<\/p><p>QUESTION: So it was not a coup detat?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Im not going to answer that question, Luis.<\/p><p>QUESTION: (Inaudible.)<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thats the implication of what I said, that may be.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. Silvia Ayuso from the German Press Agency. My question is related to Cuba. There are increasing reports, rumors, nothing yet still confirmed about a possible outbreak of cholera even that might have reached even Havana. I was wondering if you have some information, and would that be the case? Would that affect some kind of I mean, the travels to the island what could be done in this respect from the U.S.?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Let me just say that its my understanding actually that Cuba has made a statement that there is cholera but that its under control in eastern part of Cuba. And so at this point, frankly, what we know is what weve seen as the press, as all of you have. I will say that obviously if there has been an outbreak of cholera, whether its under control or not, these this is the kind of information that we often put into I dont know that we will, but we often put into our Consular Information Sheets or Travel Warnings where they exist to make sure that Americans know about that possibility. But I dont know that thats been done yet or will need to be done. Well have to see how this develops.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Next question here, and then to you.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you very much. Im Lina Correa from Voice of America, also in Cuba. A few weeks ago the State Department asked for a humanitarian act in the case of Alan Gross. Have you received any answer from the Cuban Government about that? And also, how can the public opinion in United States value that U.S. policy with regard to Cuba when we cannot see any sign of change there?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Well, I think on the first question, on Alan Gross, youre quite right. We have actually repeatedly made a request of the Cuban Government to release Alan Gross on a humanitarian basis to be home with his family, to see his 90-year-old mother whos dying of cancer, and to attend to his own health issues. And no, we have not gotten an acceptable response at this point. And obviously he is not home with his family, so that has not occurred. Despite the fact that Mr. Gonzalez was permitted by the court to see his brother, who was ill, we have not gotten that kind of action from the Cuban Government on Mr. Grosss case.<\/p><p>On the issue of change in Cuba, I think one of the things that is always hard to judge is it is difficult for us sometimes to understand, where there may be change, how much change there may be. We obviously cant venture very far outside Havana very often, and that makes it difficult for us to know what may be happening in other parts of the country. There are a lot of economic changes that have been announced, that have been talked about, that have been rumored, but not as much thats actually been implemented and thats being seen, I think, on the ground and in peoples lives.<\/p><p>But I think its interesting, when you see Raul Castro going to VietnamVietnam, which is a country which has made significant changes and with which we obviously want to see even further changes on the political side, but economic changes have already been made there is no doubt, it seems to me, that there is continued discussion and studying and interest in changes in Cuba.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, we have not seen any conversation from the governments side of political changes. Lots of conversation about economic changes that may or may not make a huge difference in peoples lives, but no changes in the ability of people to express themselves freely, to organize into political parties, et cetera. And that I mean, that does not change our policy, nor do I think it denigrates it any way. But what it does mean, I think, is that continuing the people-to-people contact that we have had, the changes that this President made to the regulations both on travel and on remittances with Cuba, are important ones to try and engage with the Cuban people in the absence of our ability to engage and see change in the Cuban Government.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: We have time for one or two more questions. Well start here.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thanks. Martha Avila from RCN TV, Colombia. Whats your opinion about the security in Colombia today? In the last days, the FARC has increased the terrorist attacks in the country. How see the U.S. Government the situation? The security in Colombia is worse?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I dont think that thats a conclusion that I would draw yet at this point, and I certainly hope its one that I wont be drawing. We certainly have seen those attacks and we are concerned about them, and we obviously deplore the violence. I want to actually make just a side comment because I failed to mention it when Jose and I were talking. I want to also reject the violence against El Norte in Monterrey, against a newspaper there.<\/p><p>But in the case of the FARC in Colombia, I think that its very clear that that is not the way forward, that the government will handle these issues and handle them well. We have confidence in the Government of Colombia. But I dont think that anyone can yet draw a conclusion that security is worse in Colombia. And I certainly hope that will not be the case and that the FARC will not return to acts of violence such as they committed in the past, which obviously we deplored and continue to. And thats not the way ahead in Colombia.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi. Im Luciana Coelho, Folha de Sao Paulo, Brazil. Just to bring back to the OAS a little bit, there are some concern from a group of NGOs and even within the OAS that there are a group of countries organized to kind of, Id say, deflate the system and the OAS and its importance. And Brazil is in its group, and also Ecuador and others. So the situation in Paraguay and the divisions within the member countries since supposed risk of exacerbation of this movement. Id like to know if the U.S. is paying any attention to that, if there is any concern, and if you see that this could harm the inter-American system.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thank you for the question. I actually I think many of you may have seen some of the comments that I made, that our delegation made, and some of the things that were said at the OAS General Assembly in Cochabamba. In particular, the OAS the inter-American system on human rights came under just fierce attack, I mean just the fiercest Ive ever seen. And that is something that worries us enormously.<\/p><p>The heart in some respects, the heart of the Organization of American States and the thing that, in my opinion, it should be most proud of is the inter-American system on human rights the commission, the court, all of the processes that have been developed over the years. You may take issue with individual decisions. The United States is brought before the commission more than any other country in the hemisphere, and we very often dont agree with the decisions. But we will defend the commission and its right to act forever, because the system is not designed for a particular case. It is not designed for a particular government. Its designed to protect the constellation of rights and democratic freedoms that we have all agreed to against any kind of incursion. And sometimes those decisions are difficult for countries. But the discomfort is the price we pay for a system that defends all of us at various times and has defended very important issues of human rights in the last 40 years in this hemisphere.<\/p><p>So I think that the OAS General Assembly was of I mean, the conversations that we held there, I think, were of great concern to us. And moving forward, we want to find ways to strengthen and yes, reform, in part the inter-American human rights system, but not to destroy it.<\/p><p>And I will say I just want to be clear about this that unfortunately, it became clear at the General Assembly that some peoples goals wasnt reform. In fact, they didnt even use the words reform. They used the words destruction. And that to me it wasnt me interpreting those words; it was what was said. So having that out on the table, maybe now we can talk about how to reform the system and in fact continue to strengthen it, even when we dont like its decisions all the time, as will happen.<\/p><p>I do think that moving ahead on the issue of Paraguay, we have an opportunity here in the hemisphere. We have an opportunity to work together on an issue that concerns all of us, which is strengthening democracy and strengthening dialogue in Paraguay. I think the way the OAS has gone about this has been very healthy and very productive, but I think there are important roles for countries in South America. And we will continue to work, for example, with Brazil on this issue very closely. We will continue to be in contact with our colleagues in Chile, in Colombia, in Peru. All of those countries are important to moving this ahead and finding a constructive outcome, which I think everybody wants. We have had good conversations with our Uruguayan counterparts.<\/p><p>So I dont I see Paraguay in some ways as a way for us to come together as a region to support Paraguayan democracy, not as an issue which will exacerbate divisions.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Could you expand your comment regarding the attacks against El Norte, if possible?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Right. I mean, the only thing I want to say about that is we have seen, obviously, violence against journalists, individual journalists, but also against newspapers or other media outlets in Mexico in the past. These attacks just unfortunately sort of continue or take that to another level, and they have to be rejected by everyone. And one of the things that worries me the most in Mexico is the threat of physical violence, which causes both, obviously, an inability to report stories just because of physical harm but also leads to self-censorship, if were not careful, because of fear, a climate of fear.<\/p><p>And so I think that we all have to stand up and speak out against that kind of violence and hope to work with the government, because I think the current government has made it very clear that they dont accept those kinds of attacks and that they want to work on resolving those cases and reducing the incidents of violence against journalists and media outlets, and that well do everything we can to help in that area.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Im afraid were out of time. I want to thank Assistant Secretary Jacobson for coming here. I hope you return soon.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thank you very much.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you.<\/p><\/body>","1012":"Stages Protests at PfizerFired Workers Stages Protests at Pfizer Tower","1508":"U.S. strike that against General MotorsLinamar Q4 Profit Drops 60% As General Motors Strike Cut Into Sales","229":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">About 100 students and community members marched from campus to Downtown Berkeley protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline on Sunday, in conclusion of an environmental justice conference held on campus over the weekend.<\/p><p>The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has previously alleged that the pipeline's approval violates the National Historic Preservation Act and puts the tribe's livelihood, sacred sites and water at risk.

A breakthrough in negotiations over the cost of health care reform. Members of the Senate Finance Committee say they found ways to trim the cost to less than $1 trillion.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Congressional correspondent Brianna Keilar, live from Capitol Hill, with details.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Brianna, why don't you get us started here. What are you learning?<\/p><p>BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Tony, this really is a significant development. Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee, which has really been seen as the best for getting bipartisan agreement, some bipartisan agreement on health care overhaul, they've been crunching numbers for the better part of a week, here, working with the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, the CBO, trying to figure out a way to get this whole thing down to a price tag that is feasible. Last week, they were told the plan that Democrats on this committee put out was 1.6 trillion dollars, which is really just prohibitively expensive.<\/p><p>And so here's the announcement today from Senator Max Baucus, the chairman for this committee, saying that they have reached some options for things they can do to be at the price tag they want.<\/p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>SEN. MAX BAUCUS (D), FINANCE CHAIRMAN: The CBO now tells us we have options that would enable us to write a one trillion dollar bill, fully paid for. We have options -- we have ways to, according to the CBO today, fully pay for this bill.<\/p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP<\/p><p>KEILAR: And an aide to the senator tells us that these options that they're looking at, under them, 97 percent of Americans, they are confident, will be covered by a health care overhaul that they're planning.<\/p><p>TONY HARRIS, CNN ANCHOR: Wow.<\/p><p>KEILAR: But now you heard him say, Tony, we have options. HARRIS: Yes.<\/p><p>KEILAR: And we're really looking for specifics, because that's what we want. But we don't know exactly what those specifics are, how are they going to pay for it, and what exactly is it going to look like. We still want to know.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Yes, yes. We do know this committee is getting closer to an answer on both of these questions, correct?<\/p><p>KEILAR: Yes, no, we do. We know that one of the things they have been looking at, and seems to be gaining traction, is the idea of taxing employer-provided health benefits. Now, we heard from Senator Chuck Grassley, the ranking Republican member on this committee. He said yesterday that one of the ideas they're looking at is for a family of four, for their health benefits package, if it were to exceed 17,000 dollars, which is very far above the national average for health benefits -- this would be considered a Cadillac Plan -- that you might tax them on the amount that goes over a certain -- that goes over 17,000 dollars.<\/p><p>So, that's one of the things they're looking at. But the exact formula, that's just him talking about one of the things they're looking at. We don't know what the exact formula is going to end up like. And then looking at what the plan may be, we talked a lot, Tony, about this health co-op idea; this is seems to be what members, Republicans and Democrats on this committee, are coalescing around, the idea of a non-profit health co-op, instead of a government-run insurance plan.<\/p><p>HARRIS: I'm sorry. I'm taking notes as you're speaking here. And we'll get to this whole idea of taxing employer-provided health benefits. We'll talk about that later. What's the sticking point on how to structure the idea of a health co-op, Brianna?<\/p><p>KEILAR: Yes, we're really focused on this, because, when it comes down to it, you want to know exactly what their plan is. How to pay for it is important. But what is it going to look like? This idea of a health co-op, the different issues that you're seeing are some liberal Democrats want a very strong federal hand in this. They want this to have enough teeth that it can compete against private insurers, and, in their opinion, through that, bring the cost down.<\/p><p>But what you have is senators like Chuck Grassley who are very fearful of that. They are fearful for what that will mean, and that it will drive private insurers out of the market. So they want a light federal touch, and at this point it's really striking that balance between these two groups.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Boy, oh boy, breaking developments. Great reporting, Brianna; appreciate it. Thank you. We'll get back to you later in the hour.<\/p><p>Let's get right to the White House to the health care developments. On the Hill, White House correspondent Suzanne Malveaux joining us live. Suzanne, you know the question's coming; how is all this playing out at the White House?<\/p><p>SUZANNE MALVEAUX, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, sure. Speaking with White House officials, they don't normally react to every little incremental step along the way here. Obviously, they're paying very close attention to what has happened.<\/p><p>This is good news. Make no mistake about it, this is very good news, because basically the one thing that the president has told members of Congress is don't come to me with a bill that you can't pay for.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Right.<\/p><p>MALVEAUX: And essentially if it is -- if it does not contribute to the federal deficit, if it is able to be paid for on its own -- deficit neutral is the term they like to use here -- well, then, that is a bill that the president is willing to sign. He has said it before.<\/p><p>So, obviously this is a very good development from the White House perspective. And then secondly, Brianna was mentioning one of those options, the possibility of putting a cap on the benefits, health care benefits, that are tax free.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Yes.<\/p><p>MALVEAUX: That is something that the president, as candidate Obama, did not agree with, did not support. Since becoming president, he's been holding a lot of these discussions, the back-and-forth with members on the Hill, there is a little bit of wiggle room here. There's a little bit of room for flexibility.<\/p><p>So, that is something that the White House is looking at and not completely dismissing. So, there's some movement here that is happening on both sides. And this is seen as a good development from the White House perspective, Tony.<\/p><p>HARRIS: And, Suzanne, I know that there was a White House event last night, where health care was the one and only topic. How did that play out?<\/p><p>MALVEAUX: Well, it was really kind extraordinary, the kind of access, a television network holding its own town hall, if you will, in the White House parlor, in the family room, as the anchors had noted, clearly underscoring that the president is just trying to get his message out any way possible, to put pressure on members of Congress, get this thing done by the fall.<\/p><p>This is considered a key window. If it doesn't happen now, Tony, they don't think it is going to happen. So, they've been pushing and pushing. And what we heard from the president last night is that yes, he acknowledges it will cost a lot, but he believes that there are ways to pay for this. I want you to take a listen.<\/p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What I've said is let's change the system so that our overall cost curve starts going down, by investing in a range of things, prevention, health IT, et cetera.<\/p><p>We will have some up front costs. And the estimates, as Charlie has said, have been anywhere from a trillion to two trillion dollars. But what we've said is, what my administration has said, what I've said, is that whatever it is that we do, we pay for, so it doesn't add to our deficit.<\/p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>MALVEAUX: And, Tony, Brianna brought up a very good point. She laid out in great detail what some of the possibilities are for raising that revenue. We've already heard from the president talking about making serious cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and some expenditures for hospitals, Tony.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Boy, a lot of news, a lot of developments here. At the White House for us, Suzanne Malveaux, appreciate it. Thanks so much.<\/p><p>MALVEAUX: Thanks, Tony.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Let's keep the health care reform drumbeat going. Good to see you. All right, a rally for health care reform is taking place on Capitol Hill. It is sponsored by this organization, Health Care for America Now. The group describes itself as a grassroots campaign made up of 1,000 organizations, representing 30 million people. Health Care for America Now says it supports comprehensive, affordable health care, including a government plan to compete with private insurance.<\/p><p>You know, health care reform, it is an incredibly confusing, complex issue. We are doing our best with it. We asked the chairman of Emory University School of Public Health what he'd do to reform health care. Here's Kenneth Thorpe's 90-second RX.<\/p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>KENNETH THORPE, EMORY UNIVERSITY: Here's my RX for the health care crisis. I'd focus on five points.<\/p><p>First, we've got to get the cost of health care under control. And one way to do that is by preventing disease in the first place. Thirty percent of the growth in health care spending in this country is due to the doubling of obesity in the United States since 1985.<\/p><p>Two, we need to do a better job of managing and working with chronically ill patients, people with Diabetes and high blood pressure. They account for 75 percent of health care spending. They have high rates of hospital admissions and re-admissions, many of which are preventable.<\/p><p>The third thing that I would do is focus on administrative costs. Our administrative costs are too high. Our system is too complicated. We need to simplify this system, so that we can reduce the cost of health care and allow physicians and patients to spend more time clinically, rather than filing claims forms and dealing with paper.<\/p><p>The fourth thing we need to do is provide more information. We know very little, ironically, about what clinical treatments work best and how much they cost. Physicians and patients and families need that information to make more appropriate health care choices.<\/p><p>And the fifth thing I would do is we have to deal with the 47 million people who don't have health insurance coverage in this country. So, we have to find a solution that is bipartisan to cover all Americans. I'm hopeful this time around in the health care reform debate that everybody's second choice is not the status quo, but we can really compromise and this time finally cover all Americans.<\/p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>HARRIS: OK.

Our international correspondent, Ivan Watson, is at the Iran desk here in the CNN NEWSROOM. And, Ivan, what can you tell us about this warning the Iranian president has for President Obama?<\/p><p>IVAN WATSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, well, he definitely accused President Obama of interfering in Iran's internal affairs. He said that -- this is in response to President Obama's recent criticism of the bloody crackdown that we've seen over the past week and a half in Iran.<\/p><p>Let me read you some of this quote that came out. Quote, \"we don't expect much from British governments and other European governments, whose records and backgrounds are known for everybody and have no dignity. But I wonder why Mr. Obama, who has come with the slogan of change, has fallen into this trap and has taken the same route that Bush took and experienced its consequences.\"<\/p><p>So, going right after the U.S. president and western governments, who have also been accused of organizing plots to destabilize Iran over the last week and a half, Tony.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Hey, Ivan, what are you hearing about further crackdowns on dissents and journalists being detained?<\/p><p>WATSON: Yes, let me take you to a photo of --<\/p><p>HARRIS: Sure.<\/p><p>WATSON: -- a Greek -- British journalist freelancer, Jassen Apenjadis (ph). And he's been detained over the past couple of days. His Greek parents have called for his release, as has the Greek Foreign Ministry. He is just one of scores of journalists who have been arrested, mostly Iranians.<\/p><p>Let's listen to this media watchdog agency out of Paris, Reporters Without Borders, what they have to say, Tony.<\/p><p>HARRIS: OK.<\/p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>JEAN-FRANCOIS JULLIARD, REPORTERS WITHOUT BORDERS: Actually, the situation now is that 59 Iranian journalists have been arrested; 59 journalists are currently detained in Iran. And the situation is -- is getting worse for foreign journalists as well, because most of the foreign journalists have already left Iran.<\/p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>WATSON: And, of course, as you've heard from our own Reza Sayah how difficult and oppressive the climate was like for journalists to operate on the ground --<\/p><p>HARRIS: Yes.<\/p><p>WATSON: -- over the past couple weeks, Tony.<\/p><p>HARRIS: And we'll talk a bit more about that with Reza in just a minute. Ivan, appreciate it. Thank you.<\/p><p>As mentioned, Reza Sayah was in Iran covering these demonstrations. He's been forced to get out of the country. I'll talk to him later in the hour about his experiences dealing with the Iranian authorities.<\/p><p>We are also following this story online at CNN.com. Extensive coverage can be found there of the election, escalating violence. There's a timeline of events also available to you. We have also uploaded some of the i-Reports from witnesses and victims at CNN.com.<\/p><p>This developing story -- a double amber alert out of North Carolina this hour; six-year-old Alexander Suddeath and his four-year-old sister Heidi went missing almost 24 hours ago in the Smoky Mountains. The children and their parents were beginning a family hike on the Appalachian Trail. The Mitchell County Sheriff says the parents lost sight of the children for just a minute. He is calling this a child abduction, although a spokesman concedes there is no specific evidence of a kidnapping.<\/p><p>Authorities plan to update reporters this hour.

She was jailed in Iran, accused of spying for the U.S. Now, freed journalist Roxana Saberi tells Anderson Cooper dramatic details of reporting and justice in Iran. \"AC 360\" tonight at 10:00 p.m. Eastern time. Today's economic news for you; first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose unexpectedly last week to the highest level in more than a month. The Labor Department said 627,000 Americans filed initial claims, up 15,000 from the previous week.<\/p><p>And a slightly improved reading on Gross Domestic Product; the Commerce Department says first-quarter GDP shrank 5.5 percent less than the previous estimate of 5.7 percent. The first quarter of 2009 marked the third quarter in a row that the economy contracted.<\/p><p>Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Capitol Hill today, addressing allegations that he pressed Bank of America's CEO to buy Merrill Lynch in an all-stock deal worth 50 billion.<\/p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>BEN BERNANKE, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: On September 15th, 2008, the Bank of America announced an agreement to acquire Merrill Lynch. I did not play a role in arranging this transaction, and no Federal Reserve assistance was promised or provided in connection with that agreement. As with similar transactions, the transaction was agreed and approved by the Federal Reserve, under the Bank Holding Company Act in November 2008. It was subsequently approved by the shareholders of Bank of America and Merrill Lynch on December 5th.<\/p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>HARRIS: Bernanke's comments come exactly two weeks after B of A CEO Ken Lewis delivered his side of the story in front of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.<\/p><p>Well, you think the job market now is bad? Just wait until the economy recovers. Where are we going here? CNN personal finance editor, Gerri Willis, is here to tell us about the new threat to the job market. All right, Gerri, I'm all ears.<\/p><p>GERRI WILLIS, CNN PERSONAL FINANCE EDITOR: All right, well, think about it, Tony. All right, if you're looking for a job right now, you know you're competing with unemployed workers in your industry. But according to a new study, once the recovery takes hold, well, you may have even more competition. More than half of workers employed right now, 54 percent, say they will start looking for a new job once the economy turns around. That's according to an HR consultancy, Adeco Group.<\/p><p>And almost three-quarters, three quarters, of Gen-Y workers are ready to jump ship. We spoke to Joanie Ruge, who says all the benefit cutting companies have been doing are taking a toll on their workers.<\/p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>JOANIE RUGE, SENIOR VP, ADECCO: All of those cuts have had an impact on employee morale. The feel like, OK, my employer has made so many cuts on benefits and perks and salary, should I go somewhere else?<\/p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) HARRIS: All right, so we've been seeing more and more companies halting 401(K) matches, putting on hiring freezes, salary freezes. And once we get closer to the end of the recession, that's not likely to be rolled back. According to Watson-Wyatt, one in five employers will keep salary reductions in place; 46 percent do not plan to reverse the increases in how much employees pay for health care premiums.<\/p><p>So some of these bad times, Tony, they're here to stay.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Yes, yes, I think you're absolutely right about that. So, what to you do if you're one of these people desperate to get out of your current job?<\/p><p>WILLIS: Well, get started now. The fact that so many people will be looking to jump ship when the economy recovers means that you want to get your search under way as soon as possible. Figure out what companies you will target. Find a way to get them to see your work or become familiar with your name.<\/p><p>And if you're working, it's easier. Get involved with trade and professional organizations. Use social media to boost your profile within your network.<\/p><p>HARRIS: OK. Real solid advice now for you, Gerri; let's say you are looking for another job and you're still employed.<\/p><p>WILLIS: Right.<\/p><p>HARRIS: What are some of the big no-nos? Help people here.<\/p><p>WILLIS: Well, OK. You don't want to be going off on your hour long lunch break all the time. And that suit you're wearing to go visit the dentist, people know something's up out there, right?<\/p><p>HARRIS: Right, right, right.<\/p><p>WILLIS: With the unemployment rate at 9.4 percent, you're better off if you do have a job. Save the interviews for after work. Don't put your resume on your work computer. Most employers, as we've talked about before here, Tony, monitor what websites you visit. They know. And nearly a third of employers have fired employees for misusing the Internet. That's according to the AMA.<\/p><p>Don't forget to look within your own company for opportunities before you jump ship. You know, think twice. Maybe it's not as bad as you think. And maybe you can ask for more responsibilities, a better title, better pay where you are right now.<\/p><p>HARRIS: That's a great point. Gerri, great advice. Great tips, as always. See you next time.<\/p><p>WILLIS: Thank you.<\/p><p>HARRIS: All right, Gerri. And as always, let's get you to CNNMoney.com. Check out our special report, America's Money Crisis.

CNN senior correspondent Allan Chernoff introduces us to one couple and tells us how they were hit and how they responded.<\/p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)<\/p><p>ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Not only were Kevin and Lucy Aikman heavily invested in the stock market last fall, but Kevin's employer, AIG, nearly collapsed. Kevin is in a stable end of the business, home insurance assessments; so the dual crisis rocking his investments and employer was especially jarring.<\/p><p>KEVIN AIKMAN, AIG EMPLOYEE: First thought is fear. What about all these years I've put in the hard work? All the money I've invested; is there going to be anything left at the end of the day?<\/p><p>CHERNOFF: For Lucy, the financial crisis has been terrifying.<\/p><p>LUCY AIKMAN, HIT HARD BY FINANCIAL CRISIS: Terrible anxiety. I -- I ended up having to go get pills because I couldn't sleep. So much anxiety.<\/p><p>CHERNOFF: Lucy lost her job as a trader on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange two years ago, and hasn't worked since. Her grown daughter also lost her job, as did Lucy's sister, who worked at Bear Stearns when it collapsed.<\/p><p>L. AIKMAN: Everybody's fearful, and everybody's falling like soldiers around me.<\/p><p>CHERNOFF (on camera): Just a few days before the stock market began collapsing last September, the Aikmans hired a contractor to chop down trees and excavate a pond by their home. Today, more than seven months later, it's still a hole in the ground. The project is on hold.<\/p><p>(voice-over:) The hole in the ground was like a hole in their pocket. It had cost 10,000 dollars. So the Aikmans chopped their spending. They gave up their personal trainer, and now exercise on their own. They postponed plans to build a screened porch, don't go out to dinner as much, and planted a vegetable garden.<\/p><p>L. AIKMAN: One of our biggest expenses is food. I mean, it sounds strange, but we eat a lot of fresh produce. And as you know, to eat healthfully, it costs money.<\/p><p>CHERNOFF: They've become more conservative investors, with help of financial planners Doug Plin and Rich Zito, who reduced their exposure to stocks.<\/p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We took it all the way down to about 15 percent stocks. If you're losing sleep, then you probably don't have the right portfolio. We need to find the right portfolio for you.<\/p><p>CHERNOFF: To sleep better, the Aikmans bought extra insurance, and Kevin is shelving his dreams of retiring in just ten years, when he'll be 55.<\/p><p>K. AIKMAN: The 401(k) just about fell in half. So when that happened, I reassessed and said, well, maybe I'm going to need to put a few more years in.<\/p><p>CHERNOFF: The Aikmans realize they can't control the economic environment that affects all of. But by cutting spending and boosting insurance, and becoming more conservative with investments, the Aikmans feel they are controlling what they can to weather the financial storm, while still being positioned to profit as it begins to pass.<\/p><p>Allan Chernoff, CNN, New York.<\/p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)<\/p><p>HARRIS: You can catch \"Money &amp; Main Street\" tonight at 8:00 p.m. Eastern on Campbell Brown.<\/p><p>He witnessed the ruthless crackdown.

Security forces crushing the latest protests against presidential election results. A ceremony today remembering victims of the two weeks of demonstrations has been postponed according to the website of one of the defeated presidential candidates.<\/p><p>Let's put all of this Iranian turmoil into some kind of context here. Our Reza Sayah has joined me.<\/p><p>And, Reza, you were -- when did you leave the country?<\/p><p>REZA SAYAH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I left . . .<\/p><p>HARRIS: When were you forced out of the country?<\/p><p>SAYAH: Yesterday. Yesterday. They gave me an ultimatum. And I think it's important to clarify that.<\/p><p>HARRIS: So you could have stayed?<\/p><p>SAYAH: I could have stayed, but they said, if you stay, we can't guarantee your safety. And they wanted me to . . .<\/p><p>HARRIS: Well, that means leave.<\/p><p>SAYAH: Yes. I mean, and I think, you know, that was a decision we made. Considering the way they delivered that message, the tone by which they delivered that message, we thought it was best to leave and that's what we did.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Reza, talk to me about your working as a correspondent doing your job, in a country where the regime does not want you to do what you're doing. At some point, you have to sense that the hammer is coming. You clearly had gotten word that, well, restrictions have been placed on your reporting. Then the ultimatum comes. How does it come? Is it a knock at the door?<\/p><p>SAYAH: It was a phone call. It was a phone call by the ministry that handles press credentials. And we had a relatively good rapport with them. But they said 4:00 p.m. Tuesday, you have to meet somebody. We said, who is it? They said, we can't tell you who it is, just show up. So we didn't know who this was that . . .<\/p><p>HARRIS: You were given a destination and you were told to show up?<\/p><p>SAYAH: Yes. But I'm an optimist by nature and I thought maybe this is our opportunity to convince them to get us back on air. So I was very optimistic going in. But, still, a little anxious about who this person was.<\/p><p>We arrive at 4:00 p.m. I was with our producer, who's still there. And they told me, he just wants to meet with you alone.<\/p><p>So, walk into this office. And very large, burly man sitting there on a couch with briefcase.<\/p><p>HARRIS: What, in a suit? In camouflage?<\/p><p>SAYAH: No, no, no.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Jack (ph) boots? What, what, what's going on here?<\/p><p>SAYAH: No, just wearing street clothes.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Right.<\/p><p>SAYAH: And I -- as soon as I get in, I start talking to him, giving him my spiel, trying to convince him this is why CNN need to be there reporting on the ground. So after my spiel he said, are you finished. I said, yes, I'm finished.<\/p><p>HARRIS: So he listened?<\/p><p>SAYAH: He listened. But then he said, are you finished? I said, yes. He goes, we have evidence that you have violated the ban on reporting. The ban that went into effect on Saturday. And we had not been on air. And he couldn't substantiated how we violated the ban, but he kept saying we have evidence that you violated that ban. But, he said, we can let bygones be bygones. HARRIS: Really?<\/p><p>SAYAH: But here's what you need to do. That's when he slid in front of me . . .<\/p><p>HARRIS: The ultimatum.<\/p><p>SAYAH: A piece of paper and a pen. He goes, I need you to write down on this piece of paper that I will no longer do any reports in Iran unless they are positive reports. And if you don't sign this agreement, he said, you have 24 hours to leave. If you don't leave, we can no longer guarantee your safety and we can't guarantee that you can come back and report in Iran.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Wow.<\/p><p>SAYAH: And that's when we made a decision that was difficult for me, because there's no way I wanted to leave at such a crucial juncture.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Right.<\/p><p>SAYAH: But we made the decision to get out of there.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Reza, appreciate it. Thanks for putting us in that room.<\/p><p>SAYAH: Sure.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Pretty dramatic stuff.<\/p><p>All right, Reza Sayah back from Tehran.<\/p><p>Want to get you a quick update on our financial picture today.

South Carolina's Republican governor, <person><nameText>Mark Sanford, <\/nameText><\/person>is facing hard questions today. Did taxpayers cover the costs of trips to Argentina where he carried on an extramarital affair? And did his dalliance destroy his future in national politics? Here's senior political correspondent Candy Crowley.<\/p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)<\/p><p>CANDY CROWLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT, (voice over): Turns out the tale of the South Carolina governor gone missing is a cliche.<\/p><p>GOV. <person><nameText>MARK SANFORD, <\/nameText><\/person>(R) SOUTH CAROLINA: So, the bottom line is this -- I -- I've been unfaithful to my wife.<\/p><p>CROWLEY: A collective groan from Republicans as another of their promising new faces on the national scene goes down the tubes.<\/p><p>RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: I wonder if Sanford thought that he was going to get away with this? They all do, I guess. He could have been our JFK.<\/p><p>CROWLEY: In a rambling, halting, teary news conference, Governor <person><nameText>Mark Sanford <\/nameText><\/person>copped to a string of bad behavior, including a 5,000-mile lie. His hike along the Appalachian Trail was a trek to Buenos Aires, reportedly to this apartment complex for a rendezvous with a longtime friend he says became a lover over the past year.<\/p><p>SANFORD: I have seen her three times since then, during that whole sparking thing.<\/p><p>CROWLEY: Mrs. Sanford knew about the sparking thing and said in a written statement she asked her husband to leave two weeks ago, but he'd earned a chance to resurrect the marriage.<\/p><p>SANFORD: So it had been back and forth and back and forth and back and forth. And the one thing that you really find is that you absolutely want resolution. And so, oddly enough, I spent the last five days of my life crying in Argentina.<\/p><p>CROWLEY: There's more. E-mails between Sanford and his lover, obtained by \"The State\" newspaper in South Carolina. The paper said the authenticity of the e-mails was confirmed by the governor's office. A spokesman for the governor would neither confirm nor deny authenticity to CNN.<\/p><p>\"You are my love,\" she wrote him. \"Something hard to believe even for myself as it's also a kind of impossible love.\" \"You have a level of sophistication,\" he wrote her, \"that's so fitting with your beauty. I could digress and say that you have the ability to give magnificent, gentle kisses, or that I love your tan lines.\"<\/p><p>In Republican circles everywhere, the wince factor is high. Damage control 101, sympathy and prayers, followed by as much distance as you can find. With warp speed, the Republican Governors Association accepted Sanford's resignation as head of the RGA. Ten days ago, Senate Republicans were just as quick, accepting John Ensign's resignation from his Senate leadership post.<\/p><p>SEN. JOHN ENSIGN, (R) NEVADA: Last year I had an affair.<\/p><p>CROWLEY: Also new to the national stage, Ensign, like Sanford, was sometimes talked about as a 2012 dark horse.<\/p><p>ALEX CASTELLANOS, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: It seems like a lot of our new leaders seem to be self-immolating.<\/p><p>CROWLEY: Good grief, said a Republican strategist, they're dropping like flies.<\/p><p>Candy Crowley, CNN, Washington.<\/p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)<\/p><p>HARRIS: Public lives, private indiscretions or so they think. Why do powerful men cheat and why do they think they can hide affairs in this age of the Internet and instant news? That was the topic on CNN's \"Larry King Live\" last night.<\/p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>LARRY KING, \"LARRY KING LIVE\": Why, Robert, do -- is the draw -- it's so powerful, it draws someone like the governor into this kind of situation?<\/p><p>ROBERT WEISS, THE SEXUAL RECOVERY INSTITUTE: I think it makes perfect sense that it would be a governor or someone like that who would be doing this, because people in power positions aren't often taking good care of themselves or the basic things they need to attend to, like their family lives. And so they get distracted by pleasurable experiences -- drugs, alcohol, sex -- and they're often running because they're not taking care of themselves. So it makes sense that he would drift into something because he . . .<\/p><p>KING: More than say a mailman would?<\/p><p>DR. DREW PINSKY, RELATIONSHIP SPECIALIST: I may address (ph) that a little bit too because the kind of person that seeks celebrity, seeks this kind of static, public life tends to me more in the narcissistic spectrum. And narcissism by itself isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it carries liabilities. People tend to feel special, entitled. They become compartmentalized, like Rob Weiss says. And the fact is, they may do things and really not perceive that they're having a consequence on other people.<\/p><p>KING: Dr. Saltz, why do you think they do it?<\/p><p>DR. GAIL SALTZ, PSYCHIATRIST: Well, I think, Larry, actually, politicians are often risk takers in addition to being potentially narcissistic people. I think it works for them in their career. You know, they push the edge. They take risks. And that helps them in their profession.<\/p><p>But, you know, the downside of that is just that, they need the constant stimulation. They want it. They're willing to push the edge.<\/p><p>This particular politician, as a matter of fact, made a lot of enemies and took a lot of risks and did a lot of things that were edgy. And so I think in a way it's not surprising. And this is why I think we're often seeing politicians doing this kind of thing.<\/p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>HARRIS: Wow, \"Larry King Live\" tonight, Elizabeth Edwards, the wife of the former presidential candidate, John Edwards.

CNN has just learned that actress Farrah Fawcett has passed away after a longtime battle with anal cancer. Our senior medical correspondent, Elizabeth Cohen, is here.<\/p><p>And, boy, Elizabeth, she tried everything.<\/p><p>ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: She did.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Over many, many years to try to beat back this cancer.<\/p><p>COHEN: She was a true empowered patient. She did not just do what doctors told her. She did what she was told and then went and found other things on her own.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Yes.<\/p><p>COHEN: She really fought hard. She was diagnosed with anal cancer in 2006. In 2007 she was told that she had gone in to remission. But then later in 2007, she was told that the cancer was back and then that it had metastasized to her liver.<\/p><p>When anal cancer spreads like that, there is a less than 20 percent chance that someone will still be alive five years later.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Wow. All right. So the news just coming in to CNN that actress Farrah Fawcett has died. She passed away this morning, 9:28 Pacific Time. An enormous star of the first order. A.J. Hammer remembers the life, the career, of Farrah Fawcett.<\/p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We proudly welcome to the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Miss Farrah Fawcett.<\/p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whoa! Farrah baby. Yes.<\/p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Farrah, look up. A.J. HAMMER, CNN CORRESPONDENT, (voice over): Farrah Fawcett will be remembered as one of the sexiest women of the 1970s. Her poster hung in the bedrooms of teenage boys around the country.<\/p><p>FARRAH FAWCETT: Hi, fellas. What are you playing?<\/p><p>HAMMER: And her breakout role as one of \"Charlie's Angels\" made her a star.<\/p><p>Fawcett was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, in 1947 and made her way to Hollywood as a 21-year-old. The blond beauty was soon dating TV star Lee Majors and appearing in commercials and on various TV shows.<\/p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mrs. Latrin (ph), this is Miss Perry (ph), my secretary.<\/p><p>HAMMER: She married and became Farrah Fawcett-Majors in 1973. And then she had her first big break.<\/p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Once upon a time, there were three little girls who . . .<\/p><p>HAMMER: In 1976, \"Charlie's Angels\" made its debut, and she was the blond. The top-rated Aaron Spelling show about three female private detectives grabbed the nation's attention. Farrah's face started showing up on magazine covers and even lunch boxes. And a poster of her in a swimsuit sold millions of copies, becoming one of the iconic images of the '70s.<\/p><p>Then, just as suddenly as her rise to fame, she made a stunning choice, deciding to leave the angels after just one season to focus on a movie career. Her popularity immediately went on the wane.<\/p><p>FAWCETT: We need him, Victor.<\/p><p>HAMMER: The next few years saw several forgettable movies like \"Logan's Run\" in 1976. She got better box office with \"Cannonball Run\" in 1981. The following year she and Lee Majors divorced.<\/p><p>But she proved that she could be a serious actress. In 1984's \"The Burning Bed.\" Fawcett took the role as a battered wife who kills her husband. A true story based on a landmark legal case. The role earned her an Emmy nomination. One of three in her career, though she never got to take home a statue.<\/p><p>She also became involved in the longest romantic relationship of her life. She dated Ryan O'Neal for 15 years before the relationship ended in 1997. And although they never married, they did have a son, Redmond O'Neal. Fawcett continued to turn heads well into middle age. She continued to get roles on TV and in the movies and shocked many by posing nude as she neared the age of 50. The magazine was one of \"Playboy's best sellers.<\/p><p>But as Fawcett approached her 60s, the spotlight turned away from Farrah the sex symbol to Farrah the celebrity battling cancer in 2006.<\/p><p>FAWCETT: The disease has spread. Suddenly there were nine tumors in my liver.<\/p><p>HAMMER: The documentary, \"Farrah's Story,\" which aired in May 2009, focused on Fawcett's battle to beat cancer and stay alive. Her courageous journey was cathartic in allowing Fawcett to finally tell her story in her own words to the world.<\/p><p>A.J. Hammer, CNN, New York.<\/p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)<\/p><p>HARRIS: And, again, the news just in to CNN, we've been able to confirm that actress Farrah Fawcett has passed away. She died at 9:28 this morning Pacific Time.<\/p><p>Elizabeth Cohen is with us now.<\/p><p>And, Elizabeth, you were mentioning just moments ago, and it's worth mentioning again, that this woman, in her fight against this cancer, was truly, in your view, an empowered patient.<\/p><p>COHEN: She was. She took her health into her own hands. She really did.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Yes.<\/p><p>COHEN: And that documentary I think speaks volumes to that.<\/p><p>The first thing she did was talk about anal cancer, which is important. There are 5,000 new cases of anal cancer diagnosed in this country every year. But people don't feel really comfortable talking about sort of that part of the body, but she was and she came out and she talked about her illness.<\/p><p>HARRIS: That's right. And I got to tell you, there are so many lasting images, as I look at these pictures of Farrah Fawcett, that are indelible in my mind. Her work as an actress, obviously. The terrific work in the film \"The Burning Bed,\" where she turned a spotlight on the whole issue of domestic violence and raised that to a national level debate in a way that it hadn't been before. Certainly in a new way. I think about the courage of that particular piece. And, my goodness, what about the iconic work on \"Charlie's Angels\"?<\/p><p>COHEN: Well, you know, when she was on \"Charlie's Angels,\" which when I was a kid, you might think, oh she's just a twitty blond . . .<\/p><p>HARRIS: Yes, yes, yes.<\/p><p>COHEN: You know, but she certainly didn't turn out that way.<\/p><p>HARRIS: No, no.<\/p><p>COHEN: I mean she really took her health care in to her own hands and made a difference in so many different issues.<\/p><p>HARRIS: All right. We are efforting any number of people who have been close to Farrah Fawcett in her life and certainly in these last few years when she has been fighting so mightily against this -- this cancer. We're going to continue to look at these tremendous images of her.<\/p><p>Tom O'Neal is on the phone with us. And, Tom, as you know, is the senior editor of \"In Touch Weekly.\"<\/p><p>Tom, good to talk to you. Thanks for getting on the line with us so quickly.<\/p><p>TOM O'NEAL, SENIOR EDITOR, \"IN TOUCH WEEKLY\": Sure.<\/p><p>HARRIS: First of all, your thoughts, and take your time here, your thoughts and your reflections on, first of all, the life of Farrah Fawcett. And then maybe you can talk about her iconic stature in American popular culture.<\/p><p>O'NEAL: This isn't just a loss of another movie star or TV star. Farrah was always our pal. She was from Texas. She had this charm and way about her that won you over when she was on the talk show circuit. You know, we went -- we followed her through this drama of her career and broken romantic relationships with Lee Majors and marriage, the ups and downs with Ryan O'neal. They never did get married, but they were together for 17 years and then, of course, got back together in recent years.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Yes.<\/p><p>O'NEAL: And she was always -- you always felt a kind of special kinship with her.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Tom, talk about -- we were just talking about -- Elizabeth Cohen and I were talking about the piece of work she did and the series, the television series, that maybe she will be most remembered for, and that's the work on the show \"Charlie's Angels.\" You know, as Elizabeth was saying, and I would second it, it would have been easy for a lot of folks to just dismiss her as being sort of the ditzy blonde. But she was even more than that in that role on that show.<\/p><p>O'NEAL: Yes. You're talking about the cancer special or the . . .<\/p><p>HARRIS: No, no, I'm talking about her work on \"Charlie's Angels.\"<\/p><p>O'NEAL: Well, think about how important \"Charlie's Angels\" was in the social context of the time. A TV show about the empowerment of women.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Yes.<\/p><p>O'NEAL: Now these were butt kickers. These were dynamic ladies, you know, coming out to take care of the bad guys. And then at the same time, she had this poster that was on every boy's bedroom wall in America.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Well, I didn't want to be -- Tom, I didn't want to be the first one to mention the poster, but I'm glad you did because, my goodness, a, what a poster. And I think you're absolutely right, that poster was everywhere. O'NEAL: And let's talk about what was extraordinary about that poster. Not just her beauty and this great tasseled mane of hair. The fact that she was not, shall we say, well endowed up on top and was flaunting that in this and was so sexy about it. And, again, think about what -- there's a consistent pattern in her career. \"Charlie's Angels,\" she was defiant and she was courageous in what she did. That poster was courageous in its way.<\/p><p>Then she did -- when she left \"Charlie's Angels,\" she did a movie called \"The Burning Bed\" on TV, which dealt with domestic violence and relationships. And then at the end of her life, she has the guts to do this painfully honest documentary about her battle with cancer that was one of the most powerful things I've ever seen. But I'm sure you were as shocked as I was when you watched it, you couldn't believe she was so generous sharing all of this intimate information about herself.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Well, Tom, yes, yes, Tom, let me be honest with you, I just I couldn't watch it. I saw some of the clips for it. And, boy, it was all the things you've described. And I just couldn't bring myself to watch it because it was so personal and so honest. It was just tough to watch. And so I didn't.<\/p><p>O'NEAL: Yes. Especially with somebody like Farrah, who -- who we think we got to know very well through the years. It's, in fact, watching a friend going through that.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Uh-huh. You mentioned \"The Burning Bed.\" I thought that was just a tremendous piece of work. And my comment about it just moments ago is that it really elevated the whole discussion on domestic violence in this country. Do you agree?<\/p><p>O'NEAL: Absolutely. It was -- it was so important at the time. And it was considered one of her greatest performances.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Right.<\/p><p>O'NEAL: And she always considered it that. She was Emmy nominated for the role as well, by the way. But the fact that Farrah, somebody that beautiful isn't supposed to have a terrible marriage and not supposed to be knocked around by her husband in that kind of role. So, you know, why is she putting up with it? There are wonderful psychological layers to the -- to her being cast in that role and why it worked so well.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Boy, Tom, tremendous. It's terrific to talk to you. And thank you for your remembrances of -- I think you're right, so much more than a movie star, but certainly a movie star, television star of the first order.<\/p><p>Tom O'Neal, senior editor, \"In Touch Weekly.\"<\/p><p>Tom, thank you.<\/p><p>We're back with more reflections on Farrah Fawcett, who passed away this morning, 9:28 Pacific Time. We're back in a moment. You're in the CNN NEWSROOM.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Well, OK, this developing story. We told you earlier in the newscast about a double Amber Alert out of North Carolina. Six-year- old Alexander Suddeath and his four-year-old sister, Heidi, went missing almost 24 hours ago in the Smoky Mountains. The children and their parents were beginning a family hike on the Appalachian Trail.<\/p><p>Well, guess what? Terrific news to report. The children have been found by rescuers. The children have been found. And they are absolutely OK.<\/p><p>A little more information here. Both were located about a mile from where they were last seen by their parents. And searchers are right now leading them back to a command post that had been set up. Let's see. Searchers located the kids after they found a shoe and that eventually led them to where the children were.<\/p><p>Both kids OK, found by rescuers and being led back to a command post. And soon we will have a happy reunion with the parents.<\/p><p>And once again, we are getting reaction, reflections on the life, the career of Farrah Fawcett. The actress passed away this morning, 9:28 Pacific Time. Farrah Fawcett dying after a long battle, a very public battle were anal cancer.<\/p><p>Let's get to Los Angeles now. Our Kara Finnstrom is there.<\/p><p>Kara, what are you hearing about the life, the passing of Farrah Fawcett?<\/p><p>KARA FINNSTROM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Tony, what we have been able to confirm with her publicist this morning is that she has died after that long, lengthy, courageous battle with anal cancer. She died, as you mentioned, at 9:28 this morning at a hospital here in the Los Angeles area.<\/p><p>We do expect to get a statement from her representative a little later on this morning. But she was an iconic '70s star. Best known, of course, for her role in \"Charlie's Angels.\" But she was only on that show for about a year before she broke her contract and went on to make a number of movies. She often said that her favorite project that she worked on was \"The Burning Bed.\" She felt that that best showcased her work.<\/p><p>In recent days, she was known very well for a documentary that she had put out. She actually taped herself, showing very intimate, private details with her battle with anal cancer. And amongst people in the cancer community, that had really made her a very popular person. They had really associated with her, her battle and were really following her very closely.<\/p><p>HARRIS: Well, Kara, I know this is probably too early to have these kinds of details, but I'll ask the question anyway. 9:28 Pacific Time she passed away. Do we have any idea who was -- where this happened? Was it in her home, in the hospital? And who was by her side?<\/p><p>FINNSTROM: We don't have those details. We do know in recent days she had a vigil at her bedside with her son and with her longtime companion, Ryan O'Neal. But we don't have those specific details.<\/p><p>HARRIS: OK. Kara Finnstrom for us in Los Angeles.<\/p><p>Kara, appreciate it. Thank you.<\/p><p>We are pushing forward now with the next hour of CNN NEWSROOM with Kyra Phillips.<\/p><\/body>","760":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Click to view full-text<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/tech\/tech-news\/google-employees-begin-walkout-over-handling-sexual-misconduct-executives-n929696\">https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/tech\/tech-news\/google-employees-begin-walkout-over-handling-sexual-misconduct-executives-n929696<\/url><\/p><p>Photos of walkouts at a variety of Google offices were posted to social media, including London and Dublin.<\/p><p>Click to view image<\/p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https:\/\/media4.s-nbcnews.com\/i\/newscms\/2018_44\/2628786\/181101-google-london-walkout-se-1247p_fc6b360c0b58ca4f84319a6519ae6d2c.jpg\">https:\/\/media4.s-nbcnews.com\/i\/newscms\/2018_44\/2628786\/181101-google-london-walkout-se-1247p_fc6b360c0b58ca4f84319a6519ae6d2c.jpg<\/url><\/p><p>Tolga Akmen<\/p><p>Google staff stage a walkout at the company's U.K. headquarters in London<\/p><p>Google employees participate in a walkout at the company's U.K. headquarters in London on Nov. 1, 2018 during a global campaign over the tech giant's handling of sexual harassment.<\/p><p>Click to view image<\/p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https:\/\/media2.s-nbcnews.com\/i\/newscms\/2018_44\/2628806\/181101-google-walkout-new-york-se-1255p_9d5d92515a92697656e39ebc4fa001c9.jpg\">https:\/\/media2.s-nbcnews.com\/i\/newscms\/2018_44\/2628806\/181101-google-walkout-new-york-se-1255p_9d5d92515a92697656e39ebc4fa001c9.jpg<\/url><\/p><p>Bebeto Matthews<\/p><p>Google employees, who walked off the job to protest the internet company's lenient treatment of executives accused of sexual misconduct, listen to speakers during a protest rally on Nov. 1, 2018, in New York.<\/p><p>Google employees, who walked off the job to protest the internet company's lenient treatment of executives accused of sexual misconduct, listen to speakers during a protest rally on Nov. 1, 2018, in New York.<\/p><\/body>","1392":"Uaw strike against General Motors: Week 2The UAW strike against General Motors: Week 2","454":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Coca-Cola workers in three Chinese cities have gone on strike after the US soft drinks giant announced it was selling its bottling interests in the country. <\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Strikes and other labour protests have surged in recent years in China, where growth is slowing and parts of the economy are moribund.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">The beverage giant announced last week it was selling all its bottling assets in mainland China to Hong Kong conglomerate Swire Pacific and COFCO Corporation, one of China's state-owned food giants.<\/p><p>The Swire transaction would cost 5.87 billion yuan ($850 million), the Hong Kong company said.
