They could even discuss their political views and debate the important issues of the day. But what if the government were empowered to determine which political views are appropriate and which are too obscene for the American public?<\/p><p> Well, it looks like this is already happening. Of course, the state has not created a social media network; they didn't have to.It appears the government is using Facebook - the world's largest social media company - tosway[2]public opinion.The Government's Fingers In FacebookThe Free Thought Project recently published areport[3]revealing that Facebook has some troubling ties to the federal government and that this connection could be enabling former state officials to influence the content displayed. The social media provider has partnered with various think tanks which receive state funding,while hiring an alarming number of individuals who have held prominent positions in the federal government. Facebook recently announced theirpartnership[4]with the Atlantic Council - which is partly funded by tax dollars - to ensure that users are presented with quality news stories. And by 'quality,' it seems that they mean 'progressive.' The council is well known for promoting far-left news sources, including the Xinhua News Agency, which was founded by the Communist Party of China. Well, that's reassuring. What red-blooded American capitalistdoesn'twant to get the news from a communist regime? But there one aspect of this story is even more troubling: the government-to-Facebook pipeline.The company has employed a significant number of former officials in positions that grant them influence over what content is allowed on the platform. Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's Head of Cybersecurity Policy, prosecuted cybercrimes at the Department of Justice under President Obama. Now, he is responsible for determining who gets banned or suspended from the network. But that's not the worst of it. He also spearheaded the company's initiative to scrub anti-war content and 'protest' movements.In a blog post, Gleicher wrote: 'Some of the Pages frequently posted about topics like anti-NATO sentiment, protest movements, and anti-corruption.' He continued, 'We are constantly working to detect and stop this type of activity because we don't want our services to be used to manipulate people.' The company has also hired others who served in key positions in the Obama administration. Some of these include:Aneesh Raman: Former speechwriter Joel Benenson: Top adviser Meredith Carden: Office of the First LadyTo make things more interesting, Facebook has also hired neocons to help them determine the type of content that is being published. So if you happen to be a conservative that isn't too crazy about interventionism, your views are not as welcome on the network as others.After all, how many times have you heard of people being banned for posting pro-war or socialist propaganda?Are Private Companies Truly Private?The notion that government officials could be using positions of power in the private industry to advance a statist agenda is disturbing, but the fact that most Americans are unaware of this is far worse.It would be inaccurate to argue that the government is controlling Facebook's content, but the level of the state's involvement in the world's biggest social media company is a disturbing development. This is not the only case of state officials becoming involved with certain industries.This trend is rampant in the certain industries in which individuals move back and forth between private organizations and the FDA. For example, Monsanto, an agricultural and agrochemical company, has been under scrutiny for itsties[5]to the federal government. It is not clear if there is anything that can be done to counteract inappropriate relations between the government and certain companies - especially organizations with the level of influence enjoyed by the likes of Facebook.But it essential that the public is made aware of these relations, otherwise the state will continue to exert influence over society - with Americans none the wiser.

In some cities, protesters will march from Verizon stores to lawmakers' offices.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">The protests will highlight the company's role lobbying to kill rules that prevent telecom giants from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what internet users see and do through discriminatory throttling. Protesters will carry signs calling on their members of Congress to speak out against Verizon's attacks on Net Neutrality and publicly oppose the FCC's plan, which is expected to be released this week.<\/p><p>See the website announcing the protests here: VerizonProtests.com<\/p><p>Ajit Pai's plan is expected to contain a \"total repeal\" of Net Neutrality protections, posing a grave threat to the future of freedom of expression, access to information, and small businesses particularly for communities of color and low income communities.<\/p><p>The December 7 protests represent growing grassroots backlash to the FCC's plan, which polls show is wildly unpopular with people from across the political spectrum. The events are supported by Team Internet, a grassroots network of nearly half a million volunteer activists spearheaded by Demand Progress, Fight for the Future, and Free Press Action Fund, three of the groups behind the massive July 12 Net Neutrality day of action that drove millions of comments, emails, and phone calls to the FCC and Congress.<\/p><p>Over recent months the groups behind the protests have organized thousands of constituents to attend more than 600 town halls and meetings with lawmakers to demand their support for Net Neutrality. A phone call campaign through BattleForTheNet.com has generated nearly 250,000 phone calls to legislators offices.<\/p><p>At the protests participants will be encouraged to take a group photo and tweet it at their local members of Congress. Where possible, protesters will march to a nearby lawmaker's office and deliver petition signatures.<\/p><p>Protests are currently planned in Phoenix, Denver, San Francisco, New York City, Indianapolis, Boston, and several other cities across the country. They're being organized by volunteers in a grassroots manner using email, texting, and social media. Local internet users can volunteer to host a protest, and then connect with other volunteers in their area and encourage them to attend. There will be a special protest event in Washington, DC, details are TBA.<\/p><p>\"This is the free speech fight of our generation and internet users are pissed off and paying attention\" said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, \"Ajit Pai may be owned by Verizon, but he has to answer to Congress, and lawmakers have to answer to us, their constituents. The corrupt bureaucrats trying to kill Net Neutrality are hoping to avoid public backlash by burying the news over the Holiday weekend. We're taking our protest from the internet to the streets to make sure that doesn't happen,\" she added.<\/p><p>\"FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has been too busy meeting with industry lobbyists and greedy Verizon executives to hear the outcry from millions of people who are joining together to reject his plan to kill off Net Neutrality,\" said Free Press Action Fund Field Director Mary Alice Crim. \"People know that the open internet is essential for accessing everything from elder care to mental health services and they're willing to fight for it. That's why Team Internet members have met face-to-face with hundreds of members of Congress and their staff, organized others in their communities, and spoken out on behalf of Net Neutrality. This momentum of popular support will spill into the streets on Dec. 7 as people protest Pai and his corporate cronies outside Verizon stores nationwide. Our message to Pai and Verizon is clear: people everywhere will not sit idle as you destroy the free and open internet.\"<\/p><p>\"Americans are sick and tired of lawmakers placing the profits of monopolistic companies like Verizon and Comcast above the interests of ordinary people,\" said Mark Stanley, Director of Communications for Demand Progress. \"Outside Washington, support for strong Net Neutrality is widespread, regardless of political affiliation. Now, with what would be a catastrophic vote by the FCC to repeal Net Neutrality looming, people are ready to take to the streets in protest and to offer Congress one last chance to answer the question: 'Do you stand for your constituents' ability to communicate and connect, or do you stand for Verizon's bottom line?'\"<\/p><p>This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 21, 2017.<\/p><p>Contact: Timothy Karr, 201\/533-8838<\/p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services<\/p><p>MSTRUCK-6083739 MSTRUCK<\/p><\/body>","1511":"Alphabet Inc.: organizing labor protests at the companyGoogle's HR chief to step down amid boiling internal tensions","1007":"Stage protests over OpelPutin slams scornful General Motors as workers stage protests over Opel U-turn","331":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">The following information was released by the U.S. Department of State:<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">MODERATOR: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Washington Foreign Press Center. Today, we are pleased to have with us Roberta Jacobson, the Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs. On June 26th through the 29th, she traveled to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. She met with leaders with from all sectors of Central American society to advance our regional partnership for a more secure and prosperous Central America. She will discuss the accomplishments of this trip and review the goals of the Western Hemisphere agenda, and it will then be opened for questions and answers. Thank you.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: All right. Thank you, Jean, and good afternoon. Its nice to see everybody again. I am relatively recently back from Central America, and I wanted to start off talking a little bit about that, about the trip, and about some of the things I saw and put it in a little bit of context, and then we can open it up to whatever everyone would like to talk about.<\/p><p>So let me start off saying that it had been about a year and a half since I had been to Central America, and so it seemed like a good idea to get back there. Obviously, this is a big focus for us, especially in our security programs, and the Central American Regional Security Program is obviously an integral part of all four of our interlocking security citizen security initiatives: the Merida Initiative in Mexico, Central American Regional Security Initiative, the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, and the Colombia Strategic Development Initiative. So it was important for me to get back to talking with some of our Central American partners.<\/p><p>I think overall one of the things that you see in Central America, which is a hallmark of what were doing around the hemisphere, really is the two areas in particular, one, that the engagement on security issues goes well beyond law enforcement and just the police or military side of security. When we talk about working with partners in the hemisphere on citizen security issues, were talking about an integrated approach to citizen security that spans the gamut, and Im going to talk about that again in a minute.<\/p><p>But the other thing I wanted to mention was it was very important to me that I highlight something that the Secretary has talked about a great deal, Secretary Clinton, which is the importance of civil society. One of the things the Secretary has said she said it at the Summit of the Americas in talking with the civil society forum, but she has repeated it since is that for us our foreign policy really does have three legs in this stool. And those legs are government and we obviously undertake a lot of government-to-government interaction the private sector and the business community, and civil society writ large. And I felt that I had had a pretty good opportunity over the last year or so to interact with governmental counterparts, and obviously I was going to do some of that on this trip, but that it was most important for me to make sure that I touch base with civil society activists because that is the sense that you cant really get in Washington. That is the value added of traveling. So that was an emphasis of the trip.<\/p><p>Since 2008, I think most of you know, the Central American Regional Security Initiative we have appropriated and disbursed close to $500 million of assistance in Central America, with the considerable amount of our focus on the three northern triangle countries: El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, which were the three that I visited. Those span the range of this integrated approach, as I mentioned, which really does run from police and security, law enforcement activity, to prosecutors, judges, public defenders, working with judicial systems, alternative dispute resolution, and onto efforts that were making in communities to strengthen communities to withstand the impact of transnational crime. And thats why over 90 percent of our assistance, bilateral assistance in Central America, is focused on core development issues health, education, issues like support for civil society and economic growth.<\/p><p>So I traveled to the three countries in that order, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. And two of the things that I think were most exciting for me were events that I was able to hold focusing on education and youth. In El Salvador, I was privileged to hand out 49 micro scholarships as part of our SEMILLA or SEED program. This has been in effect for many years, but weve amplified it more recently. The recipients were 50 percent female and all students that came from rural areas, students who might otherwise never have had an opportunity to go to the United States and study. And what was just as exciting as meeting the students who are going to study education, healthcare, small business development what was just as exciting was meeting their families, people who had traveled pretty long distances to be there for this celebration of their childrens success, and I thought that was terrific. We also had the privilege of having one of the alumni of the program with us who is a two-term mayor in La Union, of a community in La Union, and former governor, who was a participant in this SEED program when he was in high school. They will be studying at community colleges across the United States.<\/p><p>In Guatemala, I had the opportunity to go to Coban and to visit with students in our Access English program. What some folks may not know is that the Access English program in Guatemala is the largest in the hemisphere with 1,400 students, over 700 alumni, which is a little bit surprising, I think, to many people. But these kids were just remarkable. They are incredible students of English. They were very proud of what they had done. A number of the advanced students were serving as translators and interpreters for a U.S.-Guatemalan military humanitarian exercise that was underway called Beyond the Horizon, which I also visited. And they are serving with the medics, translating not from Spanish to English but from Kiche to English. And so they were just performing these invaluable services as a result of being able to take these classes in English for a number of months. And they were just remarkable and very enthusiastic about their work. So those were two of the things that I did.<\/p><p>In Guatemala, El Salvador, and in Honduras I also met with groups of civil society, human rights, nongovernmental organizations, those working in labor, working on legal reforms. And the group that I met with that was the largest was in El Salvador, but in Guatemala and Honduras I also got a very good representation of civil society. In Honduras, that included meeting with leaders of the Alliance for Peace and Justice, which is about a three-month-old civil society consortium, which I was very impressed with, impressed with their work and impressed with their enthusiasm, including Julieta Castellanos, the rector of the University in Honduras whose son was tragically killed last year.<\/p><p>In all three places, I think one of the things that left me optimistic was the fact that there were such vibrant civil society organizations engaged, doing their own work, working in communities, gathering their own statistics, challenging the government on occasion, but also working with them to try and create safer communities.<\/p><p>The other thing that impressed me was we know from statistics that communities in which we work with municipal governments, especially USAIDs programs on prevention and on economic opportunity, those communities have seen marked decreases in crime. But one of the things that impressed me the most in El Salvador was so have communities in which we are not necessarily working, but community leaders themselves are working to organize some of those same efforts. And so it really underscored the belief that you cannot fight crime without the engagement and involvement of the community and without creating some opportunities, especially for young people.<\/p><p>The other things, I had meetings in all three countries, obviously, with government leaders. In Honduras, there was a SICA meeting that was taking place, and that was the reason part of the reason that I was there. It was very exciting for me to be there for the first time as a formal observer to SICA, since the U.S. and I signed those papers a couple of months ago. The SICA meeting, as you may know, had a little bit of turbulence in one of the agreements that was being signed within SICA with Panama, but it really went very well in the end. We were able to make the statement about the importance of regional efforts and that no country can do this alone. Our programs are premised on regional cooperation to combat transnational crime.<\/p><p>But the other thing I thought was very exciting was that the SICA countries were able to sign the agreement with the EU, which was there to do so, which reinforces, I think, those of us who were members of the Friends of Central America group, remaining engaged and working together to coordinate our assistance in that part of the world.<\/p><p>So I left Central America, I think, frankly, slightly more optimistic than Ive been in a while. I think this is a very long, hard slog that is going to take quite a while, because fundamentally, the efforts against transnational crime can only be combated by stronger democratic institutions, institutions like the police and military, institutions like the judiciary, institutions like the fiscales (ph), institutions in communities. And so that is a long-term project and not one that were going to see turn around immediately. But I think people are starting to know what works and starting to replicate it, and I also think weve seen very important movement forward over the last year or two by governments to create the structures and the legal frameworks, the policy agenda that makes success possible, which is certainly a very important first step. There is still a ways to go.<\/p><p>But I also came back very encouraged by what were doing with young people. The best part of my job and I said this while I was there the best part of my job is the engagement with young people on educational issues, because that it sounds like sort of kumbaya and clich, but that actually is the way we ensure that things get better in the future. So I was very encouraged by that.<\/p><p>And I will leave you finally with a reiteration of the importance of institutions. I was listening to Fernando Henrique Cardoso over the last two days and last night when he won the Kluge Prize at the Library of Congress, which is a $1 million prize for his academic study of humanity. And he talked about a phrase that we have seen elsewhere, but I really like it in this context, which is the infrastructure of hope. And in the end, the infrastructure of hope, what it means is democratic institutions that can withstand corruption, that can withstand transnational crime, that can withstand abuse, and thats what were trying to construct with our partners in Central America. So let me stop there and open things up.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. So first question, well go right here. Just wait for the microphone and state your name and<\/p><p>QUESTION: Jesus Esquivel from Proceso Magazine. Roberta, I have two questions for you one on Central America and the other on Mexico. The President-elect of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, has said hes going to change the strategy in the war on drugs, especially with the relation of the United States. He wants to demilitarize the strategy, and second, he says hes going to concentrate more on the issue of security for the Mexican people. And he says the measure of success is not on the number of confiscation of drugs and the arrest of the capos in Mexico.<\/p><p>My question to in this regard is: Is the U.S. Government worried about it? You know very well the issue of narcotics in Mexico, and that will probably increase the number of drugs crossing the border if hes going to do exactly what hes saying. Are you guys worried about it? I know youre going to say, We are ready to work with him, but the State Department already said that.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Youre answering your own question, Jesus. (Laughter.)<\/p><p>QUESTION: Well, but Roberta, we need more<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Its a fair question.<\/p><p>QUESTION: We need more specific answer to that. And the second is on Central America. He also said that one of his priorities will be working with Central America and trying to include Brazil on that. And he says the Merida Initiative is not working as it was planned on Central America. So he says he want to have more hemisphere approach to the problem of the security and international crime in Central America. Whats your position on that?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Okay. Thanks. I appreciate that, and let me start with the first question. Im not going to surprise you. Im not worried. And part of the reason Im not worried is because I think weve certainly watched and listened to everything that Enrique Pena Nieto has said before the election and now since the election, and youre right, Im going to say that we look forward to working with him, which we do.<\/p><p>But its also true that I have seen nothing in anything he has said that gives me cause for concern. The notion that somebody wants to re-look at a strategy and possibly make changes I think is not only to be expected but a healthy thing. Strategies get put into place to respond to a moment in time and hopefully move you forward, right, in the fight against transnational organized crime. But they also have to be adaptable. They have to shift and change, because we know that the criminal organizations shift and change.<\/p><p>We also know, and I would say much more broadly, that the notion that you want to go from whats your measure of success is it drugs interdicted, is it rates of homicide or violence I have always said, and I think we have said from the beginning with the Merida Initiative, that there are many multiple metrics that you can use and that clearly the level of violence in Mexico is unacceptable to Mexicans and it should be unacceptable to all of us. And so the fact that that is an important metric for the President-elect, I think is entirely logical. I dont think it necessarily means there will be less drugs interdicted. I dont know exactly what changes to the strategy the new President may make and what those changes what effect those changes will have on the cartels. I think well have to wait and see. But its a very productive conversation to have. And it is clearly one of the things you hear from all over the region, is that the level of violence is too high, that that has to go down. Its why we have seen changes in the way that people approach this problem. Its why you see changes like the truce that was brokered in El Salvador with the gangs. There is a real desire to lower that level of violence that is entirely understandable.<\/p><p>But I would also say that when you talk about Central America and where Mexico may shift or emphasize engagement with Central America, I think thats incredibly encouraging. I think thats exactly the right message, which is that we all have to be working better together, that Mexico has an enormous amount to contribute even while it is confronting these problems at home, but that there are others in the hemisphere who have something that they can bring to the table to support efforts in Central America. Weve seen that already, quite frankly, very actively and very positively with Colombia, in Central America, and with Chile, already engaging with those countries on ways of doing business and ways of combating corruption and criminal activity that have been successful and can be modeled or replicated or adjusted for Central America.<\/p><p>The notion of whether Brazil can also play a role on that, I think is a very positive conversation to have. I think certainly the Brazilians have capabilities and have experience that can be useful, and we think the more partners from within the hemisphere that can help in Central America, the better.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. For our next question, well go in the front here to Sonia.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi. Thank you. My name is Sonia Schott. I am with Globovision, Venezuela. Heavyweight Republicans have criticized the politics towards the political strategy towards Venezuela. I was wondering if you have any comments on that, if you agreed on that, because it seems to be that the bilateral relations are in a freeze point. It is because the electoral year, not only here but in Venezuela, and that makes me go to my second question. You have repeatedly asked for a transparent process, electoral process in Venezuela. What did that mean? What will need to happen in Venezuela in order for you to recognize it was a transparent electoral process? Does it has to do with the electoral missions? Thank you.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thank you. I appreciate that. I think it probably will not surprise you that I disagree with the notion that we do not have a good policy on Venezuela. I think the thing about our policy on Venezuela is and I would argue that, yes, we are both in electoral years; yes, electoral years in every country in the world make international relations more complicated because domestic politics takes precedence in many ways. But I would argue to you that the relationship that we have with Venezuela, if indeed its frozen and I dont disagree that it is not as productive as it could be right now but that that started before certainly before our electoral calendar really picked up, and it was independent of that. And frankly, it is disappointing to us because we are willing to and happy to engage on practical issues where we can cooperate or we may see things the same way. But we have not had that reciprocated from the Venezuelan Government, and thats unfortunate.<\/p><p>We also obviously would like to be able to cooperate on issues of regional importance, but that has not been possible because the Venezuelan Government has not seemed eager to do that, to work with us, as opposed to speaking, in the rhetorical sense certainly, against some of the United States initiatives and some of our efforts. So that is disappointing to us. And we remain ready to have that more productive relationship, but not willing to do anything more than extend that hand. And if it is not reciprocated, then we arent willing to take that any further. Its just not productive.<\/p><p>Let me also say, though, that on the elections, I think there are very clear ways in which Venezuela can ensure that the international community at large not just the United States, which frankly is not necessarily the arbiter here, it is the international community at large can have confidence in the results. And the way to do that is to welcome in observers. And so we hope that that will be the case, that Venezuela will welcome in observers, whether from the EU or the OAS. I think that would make a very large difference in the confidence that those in the international community have in the results.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. For our next question, well go to New York.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Yes. Hello. I am Ana Baron from Clarin of Argentina. Thank you very much for this press conference. I have two questions on Argentina. First of all, while we know that trade restrictions was one of the subjects you discussed on your last trip to Argentina, so I wanted to know since then there was the United States complaint in the WTO. Now Argentina, some time ago some minutes ago, hours ago has presented a complaint against the lemons and meat restrictions in U.S. market. So I wanted to know if we are assisting to a little trade war between the two countries.<\/p><p>And second, I have a question of narco-trafficking. You were talking a lot about narco-trafficking in Central America. Since the plane the military plane was detained in Ezeiza, it seems that the cooperation between the two countries has diminished significantly. I wanted to know if this is a subject that worries and if you see some prospective of ameliorating the relationship at this on this subject.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thank you. I think on the first point, on the trade issues, it certainly wasnt the central part central component of my visit there. Im not a trade expert for the U.S. Government. But I certainly did have conversations, and we continue, obviously, as you note, in these movements more recently to continue to have conversations with Argentina about concerns that we have, whether on specific trade issues or on import restrictions and other things that U.S. companies are finding difficult in Argentina. We continue again to look for a way that we can cooperate on these issues, but we do think that there are international rules and regulations that we all have to abide by. And its one of the reasons why the WTO is there, why organizations like ICSID or SIAVE (ph)*, the organization to arbitrate financial disputes. What we believe in is a rules-based system in which folks actually comply with the rules, which we will do when the decisions go against us and we hope other countries will do when decisions go against them.<\/p><p>So were still trying to work through all of these issues, but I will say that there is a desire on both parties sides, I think certainly speaking for the United States Government to try and resolve those issues in as productive a way as we can, and to try and recognize that we have lots of other components of a bilateral relationship that can move ahead. And we want to be sure that while we work on those economic, commercial, or trade problems that we may have in the relationship, they do not, frankly, bleed into other areas of the relationship where we have a more positive engagement and we are able to move forward.<\/p><p>When I was in Argentina in February, two of the things that I worked on and that I think that Im particularly excited about are moving forward on educational exchanges, which, frankly, are pretty low between Argentina and the United States. I think theres head room there, room to grow.<\/p><p>And so weve moved forward with an agreement with the Argentine Government on some additional scholarships and pushing up those numbers. And I had a meeting with 13 rectors of universities that was very productive, as well as with the Minister of Education. But we also signed a sister parks agreement for our national parks, which I think is also very important, and was very impressed by the Argentine presentation on that.<\/p><p>In following up on that, we now have we had the NASA administrator who went to Argentina. And we have Tecnopolis, I think opening this week perhaps in Argentina, with an exhibit from the United States. So theres lots of other areas in which we can cooperate.<\/p><p>Getting to your second question because I think it relates, obviously cooperating on narcotics is one of those areas where I think that we should still be able to work together regardless of other problems. And its also true that cooperation on security issues, in particular narcotics\/counternarcotics efforts, was clearly set back by the incident last year. I am pretty optimistic that were going to be able to move ahead on a cooperative agenda on narcotics issues. I think there is a desire on the part of the Argentine Government to move ahead on that, and I certainly will confirm that there is a strong desire on our part.<\/p><p>So Im more optimistic probably even than I was when I was in Argentina four or five months ago that we can move ahead on that productively.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Great. For our next question well go in the front right here.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Jacobson. This is Tomas Guevara, the editor of El Diario de Hoy, Salvador. When you visited recently El Salvador, the countrys in a serious political crisis now. What do you think about that situation between the conflict with the national assembly, with the supreme court, and how it can impact the relationship with the U.S.?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I think its an incredibly important question, and I was struck obviously by that dispute between the assembly and the court when I was in El Salvador. And I obviously spoke with a lot of people about it to learn as much as I could, to hear from folks on the ground what they saw as the prospects for resolution. And this was I was there just before July 1. Now weve passed that July 1 date, and so in some respects the issue has gotten even more acute.<\/p><p>And I would say this does concern us very greatly. This is clearly something that Salvadorans have to resolve, that we have said clearly, both I have said it in El Salvador but our Ambassador and we were all thrilled to have Mari Carmen Aponte back in San Salvador as our Ambassador has said publicly that we really do urge in the strongest terms possible that the two sides of this dispute really try and come together and resolve it. And I think thats important. It is a Salvadoran dispute to resolve; it is not ours to opine on how it gets resolved. We would just like to see it resolved.<\/p><p>But I will say that there are some issues that are important to us that engage the court or the national assembly, and those things are being, frankly, held up by this dispute. The question of extraditions, which there are a number of extraditions pending, and we think its important that extraditions be part of not the only available tool but part of the tool kit that governments be able to use to fight transnational crime. Those may not move ahead while this dispute simmers.<\/p><p>There is discussion in El Salvador, I certainly heard from all sides, of new investment laws and things that need to move ahead in the national assembly, which would be very important and very, I think, beneficial for the Partnership for Growth effort that were undertaking with El Salvador and the efforts that were trying to make to move ahead on economic development. If those things get slowed down by this dispute, then thats a problem that really affects more than just El Salvador, unfortunately.<\/p><p>QUESTION: A follow-up?<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Sure. A follow-up.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi. This is Luis Alonso. Are you concerned with the stability of the President Funes Government? Because of this dispute, is there a state of rule of law in danger by this dispute?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I confess to you, I have seen lots of breathless commentary about this. And theres no doubt in my mind that this is a serious concern and a serious problem that needs to be worked out, but I have absolutely no concerns about the stability of the Funes Government and its sort of democracy surviving in El Salvador. This is a dispute between two branches of government. I have every confidence that Salvadorans from the various branches of government will resolve this is an amicable and legal and constitutional way, and that overall the democratic health of El Salvador will not suffer for it.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. The next question well go here and then to Denise after.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Santiago Tavara from Notimex. Do you have any update on the in Honduras the recent incidents, two incidents that involved DEA agents? And about the first incident, I think Spokesperson Victoria Nuland told us that she would release a report in the next weeks. I dont know if you have a date. And also, the second question is on Peru regarding human rights abuses reported against people who are protesting against gold mine<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Conga.<\/p><p>QUESTION: -- a proposed mine in Peru from the U.S.-based Newmont Mining Corporation. I dont know if you have any reaction.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Well, let me start on Honduras. Obviously, weve been in engaged with in support of the Honduran Government in operations against narcotics trafficking in northern Honduras, coastal Honduras, in the last number of months. In those operations, over two and a half tons of cocaine was seized in two-plus just over two months, which is an extraordinary record. I want to say clearly from the outset that in the first incident and Im not sure which first or second were talking about, but May 11th, in which it would appear from the reports that weve seen certainly from the preliminary reports that four people were killed. And that is never what you want to happen, and we regret that greatly. That was an incident in which it was not the DEA but Hondurans who were firing guns and fired upon.<\/p><p>But in all of these incidents, I think we have to wait until the investigations and the reviews are concluded. What we will do as things proceed is we will obviously be reviewing with our Honduran counterparts exactly what the operations how they worked, what worked well, what didnt work well, how can we avoid, obviously, any deaths in the future.<\/p><p>And I will also say that in the second two incidents, which were ones in which DEA did unfortunately the DEA agents did unfortunately kill those who were trafficking drugs, we do expect, frankly, that those actually doing the trafficking will resist losing their cargo and being arrested. And unfortunately, it is a very dangerous game. What we want to try and ensure with our Honduran partners is that nobody who is not involved in narco-trafficking is wounded or killed as a consequence of these operations.<\/p><p>But I think that it does reinforce the importance of that area physically, geographically, in terms of the root of cocaine up north towards the United States. And we have seen lots of indications polls taken in Honduras of support for our continued engagement, and the government has made clear that they would like the United States to remain engaged in that support and training role.<\/p><p>The second question was on Peru and reports of human rights abuses to those protesting. Its the Conga Mine, I assume. And to be honest with you, Ive seen some of the press reports, but I dont have any independent information on that. Obviously, its always worrisome when you have a situation in which there is violence, in which protest is not carried out peacefully. And what we would like to see and obviously in support of the Peruvian Government, its not a role for us is a resolution to the very difficult situation that has emerged between the community and the mining company. And I think the Peruvian Government is trying to resolve that as best they can.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Im Denise Chrispim Marim from O Estado de Sao Paolo, Brazil. Thank you very much for this opportunity. We were waiting for a long time for this.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Im sorry. (Laughter.)<\/p><p>QUESTION: Well, I wonder (inaudible) and I wanted to ask you what is exactly the position of United States in the case of the crisis in Paraguay, particularly if you how is your assessment on the sanctions that has already been imposed against Paraguay by regional organizations? And how could be the best approach of OAS in this case?<\/p><p>Secondly, if you dont mind<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: That was all the first? Wasnt that like three parts?<\/p><p>QUESTION: No, it is you know that there is a lot of talks and speculations on a meeting between military American militarys and Paraguayan officials in Asuncion last days. And there is some speculations on the interest of America to build a military base in Paraguay. I wonder to know if you are aware about this information and if it is really a desire of United States.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Okay, let me start out with that second part, because I want to be very, very clear about this. I have no information about U.S. military meeting with Paraguayan counterparts or officials in recent days. So Im not sure what thats referring to.<\/p><p>We have no desire no desire, let me be clear about this to do anything in Paraguay that isnt either requested by the Paraguayan Government or an event, an occasion, a training, an engagement that is a partnership with Paraguay. And we have no interest in promoting a base or military presence in Paraguay separate or apart from sort of our normal interaction with the Paraguayans on counternarcotics issues, on training issues, on counterterrorism. We have engaged in that kind of cooperation very transparently for years, and we hope to continue to do that. That is very different than this notion of building bases, which I really want to dispel, because it does keep coming up, which I find somewhat bizarre.<\/p><p>The other thing I want to be clear about is that we are not only transparent about what our interests and our opportunities or engagement is with the Paraguayans to the public, to our own officials, to the Congress, but to anybody else in the region whos interested. And obviously weve had conversations with our Brazilian counterparts on what each of us are doing cooperatively with Paraguay, and so that there will never be surprises in that area.<\/p><p>On the crisis in Paraguay, I think one of the things that I think is important is the report of the OAS was presented to the Permanent Council yesterday, I guess, and we were obviously very pleased to be part of that mission. The mission was made up of the U.S., Mexican, Canadian, Haitian, and Honduran ambassadors to the OAS plus the Secretary General and I think one or two of his staff. I think that that mission really got a huge spectrum of opinions while they were there all of the branches of government, President Lugo and members of his cabinet, and so meeting with President Franco and folks from his cabinet and other organizations. So I think that was a very, very important step for the OAS to take because I do think that there were conversations that needed to take place about why things happened the way they did and what justification there was for things that hadnt really taken place. So I think that that was a very important first step, and we strongly support the Secretary General in that mission. That was certainly clear by our sending our ambassador. And we continue to support his efforts and think the report is really quite well done.<\/p><p>As we look forward because I think that what we really want to do is focus on the future and what assistance Paraguay may ask for and need from the OAS in terms of preparations for elections, dialogue on issues that are still of concern and creating tension, moving ahead to ensure that in this transition period, Paraguay gets ready for exemplary elections in April of 2013. And I think in that respect, we have an enormous amount in common with all of our regional partners who I think also want to look ahead and cooperate in helping Paraguay get to that point.<\/p><p>In terms of what sub-regional organizations may have done, sanctions or suspensions, I think thats for them to comment on. Weve been very comfortable with where the OAS is on this, and we think its an excellent forum for continued engagement.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Follow-up? (Laughter.)<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Well go to the follow-up and then to your question or is it a follow-up as well?<\/p><p>QUESTION: No, its a follow-up, but about another issue. So we can follow up this one.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. (Laughter.) So you pick.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Rock, paper, scissor.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi. Yes. Youve said that the report by the Secretary General of the OAS was quite well done. I wanted to know what your assessment is, what your opinion is, on his concrete proposals to send a mission to Paraguay until the elections, and also if you think that, as he said, that its not a constructive step to suspend Paraguay from the organization.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Name your media organization?<\/p><p>QUESTION: Its EFE.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I will give you the short answer to that as yes on both questions. The only thing I would add is I think the report is very well done. I think the notion of sending a mission, sending technical experts and that could change. It depends on what Paraguayans feel they need or what the skills are that is needed at the time. And as you get closer to election, different kinds of skills are needed. But I think the notion of having the OAS remain engaged with a mission in Paraguay is a very good one, a very positive one that I think would be helpful I believe and I hope for Paraguay and for all of the rest of us trying to sort of grapple with the issue. And I think that hes right, that at this point there really doesnt appear to be a reason to suspend Paraguay from the OAS.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: So now to your follow-up question.<\/p><p>QUESTION: So thank you for doing this. I am Silvia Pisani from La Nacion in Argentina. Also, so first, I would like to ask you a very specific follow-up in the first question about Argentina, and then I will jump into another line. But the follow up is: Also, I saw some concern in the United States about a specific point of the currency exchange policy in Argentina, regarding the possibility of buying dollars. And this was affecting the American enterprises to their imports because they cant buy the dollars that they need to import.<\/p><p>And also, its beginning to now, its beginning to generate some fear in the population of the possibility of traveling abroad. So I would like to ask you if you still have those concerns and if you specifically raised them to the Argentinean Government, and if that is the case, if you received any answer about that. Thats the first point.<\/p><p>And jumping in another line, I would like to ask you: I have been seeing in the Congress particularly some concern about the freedom of expression and the freedom of press in Argentina. I would like to ask your opinion about that. Thank you.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Okay. Thank you. What I can tell you in terms of the currency issue or the ability of, in particular, U.S. businesses to operate and be able to get currency out of the country, for example, which is one of the things I heard a great deal about when I was in Argentina in February, one of the difficulties that some of our companies are having is that for many of them, it may not be that difficult because theyre not they dont operate with huge amounts of cash. For certain sectors and I think you can probably figure out which ones; it may be airlines, it may be others but for certain sectors who get a lot of revenue in cash, if you will, they have difficulties. And some of these restrictions were making things difficult for them. And so what we had asked at the time was that the Government of Argentina look at the impact of some of these restrictions, which are very broad, on particular sectors which maybe have more acute difficulty with them. And so thats a continuing discussion that were having with the Argentine Government.<\/p><p>On freedom of expression, I guess I should say: We have talked a lot about this over the last year or so. Weve talked about our concerns for journalists in the hemisphere all of you, every day, know this for your brothers and sisters working in countries throughout the hemisphere, we see with a great deal of, I think the word is just sadness and anguish, when international organizations put out statements about this region being the most dangerous for journalists. I mean, that is really sometimes shocking to us. And that danger, obviously, has come from different quarters. And its come ferociously from organized crime, frankly. But there have been other threats to journalists work not to their lives, let me be clear, but to their work and to the freedom of expression that has been mounted by governments. Whether its lawsuits, whether it is withdrawal of revenue or advertisement, whether it is shutting things down, there are threats that confront journalists. And that it seems to us really critically important as part of democracy in the hemisphere. A free press is not optional. Its an integral part of democracy in the hemisphere.<\/p><p>Now, I think you would probably agree that in Argentina we certainly could not say that there is not an opposing view in the press to that of the government. There is certainly a healthy, open, exchange in the press. But I do think its important that we continue to press to ensure that governments understand that you really dont want to start down the slippery slope of trying to reduce the amount of freedom and ability to get their message out, the news out, the information out, because it can be a slippery slope, and thats very, very frightening for all of us.<\/p><p>I should say that I think there are lots of new ways of getting information, and so when people talk about press freedom and media ownership in the hemisphere as being too concentrated or its only one view of the situation in a particular country, it seems to us that the answer to that is essentially further democratization of media and press, which becomes easier in our digital and social media age, not a narrowing of that voice.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Okay. Well go to Jose and then in the front here.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. Thank you for doing this really. Jose Diaz-Briseno with Reforma from Mexico. When talking about the understandable, well, a concern in Mexico to lower the violence, specifically the homicide rate, you mentioned the truce of murders in El Salvador. Do you think thats a model that could be feasible and desirable in Mexico between the cartels?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I think that every case is different. And I think that truces have to be seen and this is what I have certainly heard from experts on this subject, and I am not one of them. I will preface with that. But I have certainly heard from experts on this that the one thing you have to be sure of is that truces ceasefires, as theyre often called in the United States; ceasefire Chicago, Boston has tried some of these theyre never a permanent answer, right? So they are at best, even where they work and they dont always work they are at best a temporary measure while you put into place more structural and institutional changes to reduce either violence or drug trafficking or homicide or whatever or gang activity.<\/p><p>And so I think one of the things that we need to be a little bit careful of is the notion that a truce is what we all continue to look for, sort of the magic bullet, the single thing you can do that will solve this problem. And I think some of this the structure of organized crime and narcotics trafficking I think is significantly different than gang activity. And so I think both the multiplicity of players and the trade that theyre in make it much more complicated and much less likely that is a productive tool in that particular setting. But I think thats something that obviously people look at all the time, both academics and practitioners.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi, again. Just to going back to Paraguay, just want to make sure that the assessment on whether or not the impeachment of President Lugo is a coup detat has been finished. Have you guys reached a conclusion, like the OAS expressed yesterday, or youre still assessing the --<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Well, I think what I would say is that the OAS and what the Secretary General set out in his report makes a lot of sense to us. The Secretary General talked about concerns over the rapidity or the speed of the process. We have expressed those concerns publicly. But he also talked about the constitution in Paraguay and what it provides for. And so he is striking that balance between a process that may have seemed too rapid but also is set out in their constitution. And so I think the most important thing we support his report, and the most important thing at this point is to look for constructive ways moving forward to engage with the Paraguayans, including with the Franco government, to get to the elections next year.<\/p><p>QUESTION: So it was not a coup detat?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Im not going to answer that question, Luis.<\/p><p>QUESTION: (Inaudible.)<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thats the implication of what I said, that may be.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. Silvia Ayuso from the German Press Agency. My question is related to Cuba. There are increasing reports, rumors, nothing yet still confirmed about a possible outbreak of cholera even that might have reached even Havana. I was wondering if you have some information, and would that be the case? Would that affect some kind of I mean, the travels to the island what could be done in this respect from the U.S.?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Let me just say that its my understanding actually that Cuba has made a statement that there is cholera but that its under control in eastern part of Cuba. And so at this point, frankly, what we know is what weve seen as the press, as all of you have. I will say that obviously if there has been an outbreak of cholera, whether its under control or not, these this is the kind of information that we often put into I dont know that we will, but we often put into our Consular Information Sheets or Travel Warnings where they exist to make sure that Americans know about that possibility. But I dont know that thats been done yet or will need to be done. Well have to see how this develops.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Next question here, and then to you.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you very much. Im Lina Correa from Voice of America, also in Cuba. A few weeks ago the State Department asked for a humanitarian act in the case of Alan Gross. Have you received any answer from the Cuban Government about that? And also, how can the public opinion in United States value that U.S. policy with regard to Cuba when we cannot see any sign of change there?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Well, I think on the first question, on Alan Gross, youre quite right. We have actually repeatedly made a request of the Cuban Government to release Alan Gross on a humanitarian basis to be home with his family, to see his 90-year-old mother whos dying of cancer, and to attend to his own health issues. And no, we have not gotten an acceptable response at this point. And obviously he is not home with his family, so that has not occurred. Despite the fact that Mr. Gonzalez was permitted by the court to see his brother, who was ill, we have not gotten that kind of action from the Cuban Government on Mr. Grosss case.<\/p><p>On the issue of change in Cuba, I think one of the things that is always hard to judge is it is difficult for us sometimes to understand, where there may be change, how much change there may be. We obviously cant venture very far outside Havana very often, and that makes it difficult for us to know what may be happening in other parts of the country. There are a lot of economic changes that have been announced, that have been talked about, that have been rumored, but not as much thats actually been implemented and thats being seen, I think, on the ground and in peoples lives.<\/p><p>But I think its interesting, when you see Raul Castro going to VietnamVietnam, which is a country which has made significant changes and with which we obviously want to see even further changes on the political side, but economic changes have already been made there is no doubt, it seems to me, that there is continued discussion and studying and interest in changes in Cuba.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, we have not seen any conversation from the governments side of political changes. Lots of conversation about economic changes that may or may not make a huge difference in peoples lives, but no changes in the ability of people to express themselves freely, to organize into political parties, et cetera. And that I mean, that does not change our policy, nor do I think it denigrates it any way. But what it does mean, I think, is that continuing the people-to-people contact that we have had, the changes that this President made to the regulations both on travel and on remittances with Cuba, are important ones to try and engage with the Cuban people in the absence of our ability to engage and see change in the Cuban Government.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: We have time for one or two more questions. Well start here.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thanks. Martha Avila from RCN TV, Colombia. Whats your opinion about the security in Colombia today? In the last days, the FARC has increased the terrorist attacks in the country. How see the U.S. Government the situation? The security in Colombia is worse?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: I dont think that thats a conclusion that I would draw yet at this point, and I certainly hope its one that I wont be drawing. We certainly have seen those attacks and we are concerned about them, and we obviously deplore the violence. I want to actually make just a side comment because I failed to mention it when Jose and I were talking. I want to also reject the violence against El Norte in Monterrey, against a newspaper there.<\/p><p>But in the case of the FARC in Colombia, I think that its very clear that that is not the way forward, that the government will handle these issues and handle them well. We have confidence in the Government of Colombia. But I dont think that anyone can yet draw a conclusion that security is worse in Colombia. And I certainly hope that will not be the case and that the FARC will not return to acts of violence such as they committed in the past, which obviously we deplored and continue to. And thats not the way ahead in Colombia.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Hi. Im Luciana Coelho, Folha de Sao Paulo, Brazil. Just to bring back to the OAS a little bit, there are some concern from a group of NGOs and even within the OAS that there are a group of countries organized to kind of, Id say, deflate the system and the OAS and its importance. And Brazil is in its group, and also Ecuador and others. So the situation in Paraguay and the divisions within the member countries since supposed risk of exacerbation of this movement. Id like to know if the U.S. is paying any attention to that, if there is any concern, and if you see that this could harm the inter-American system.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thank you for the question. I actually I think many of you may have seen some of the comments that I made, that our delegation made, and some of the things that were said at the OAS General Assembly in Cochabamba. In particular, the OAS the inter-American system on human rights came under just fierce attack, I mean just the fiercest Ive ever seen. And that is something that worries us enormously.<\/p><p>The heart in some respects, the heart of the Organization of American States and the thing that, in my opinion, it should be most proud of is the inter-American system on human rights the commission, the court, all of the processes that have been developed over the years. You may take issue with individual decisions. The United States is brought before the commission more than any other country in the hemisphere, and we very often dont agree with the decisions. But we will defend the commission and its right to act forever, because the system is not designed for a particular case. It is not designed for a particular government. Its designed to protect the constellation of rights and democratic freedoms that we have all agreed to against any kind of incursion. And sometimes those decisions are difficult for countries. But the discomfort is the price we pay for a system that defends all of us at various times and has defended very important issues of human rights in the last 40 years in this hemisphere.<\/p><p>So I think that the OAS General Assembly was of I mean, the conversations that we held there, I think, were of great concern to us. And moving forward, we want to find ways to strengthen and yes, reform, in part the inter-American human rights system, but not to destroy it.<\/p><p>And I will say I just want to be clear about this that unfortunately, it became clear at the General Assembly that some peoples goals wasnt reform. In fact, they didnt even use the words reform. They used the words destruction. And that to me it wasnt me interpreting those words; it was what was said. So having that out on the table, maybe now we can talk about how to reform the system and in fact continue to strengthen it, even when we dont like its decisions all the time, as will happen.<\/p><p>I do think that moving ahead on the issue of Paraguay, we have an opportunity here in the hemisphere. We have an opportunity to work together on an issue that concerns all of us, which is strengthening democracy and strengthening dialogue in Paraguay. I think the way the OAS has gone about this has been very healthy and very productive, but I think there are important roles for countries in South America. And we will continue to work, for example, with Brazil on this issue very closely. We will continue to be in contact with our colleagues in Chile, in Colombia, in Peru. All of those countries are important to moving this ahead and finding a constructive outcome, which I think everybody wants. We have had good conversations with our Uruguayan counterparts.<\/p><p>So I dont I see Paraguay in some ways as a way for us to come together as a region to support Paraguayan democracy, not as an issue which will exacerbate divisions.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Could you expand your comment regarding the attacks against El Norte, if possible?<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Right. I mean, the only thing I want to say about that is we have seen, obviously, violence against journalists, individual journalists, but also against newspapers or other media outlets in Mexico in the past. These attacks just unfortunately sort of continue or take that to another level, and they have to be rejected by everyone. And one of the things that worries me the most in Mexico is the threat of physical violence, which causes both, obviously, an inability to report stories just because of physical harm but also leads to self-censorship, if were not careful, because of fear, a climate of fear.<\/p><p>And so I think that we all have to stand up and speak out against that kind of violence and hope to work with the government, because I think the current government has made it very clear that they dont accept those kinds of attacks and that they want to work on resolving those cases and reducing the incidents of violence against journalists and media outlets, and that well do everything we can to help in that area.<\/p><p>MODERATOR: Im afraid were out of time. I want to thank Assistant Secretary Jacobson for coming here. I hope you return soon.<\/p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JACOBSON: Thank you very much.<\/p><p>QUESTION: Thank you.<\/p><\/body>","1464":"London climate protest against GoogleNursing mothers stage London climate protest against Google","113":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\"\/><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Oct 11, 2016( Global Voices: <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/globalvoicesonline.org\">http:\/\/globalvoicesonline.org<\/url> Delivered by Newstex)  [ Image removed: Photo published on EthioTube page titled \"Pictures from Oromo Protest - Winter 2015\".

All mobile internet services have been shut down in Ethiopia for\u00a0the last seven days, amid increasingly violent\u00a0protest scenes and a recently declared a 'state of emergency'.[1] Demonstrations have taken place with regular frequency\u00a0in Ethiopia's\u00a0Oromia[2]\u00a0region since November 2015, with protesters demanding greater self-rule, freedom and respect for the ethnic identity of the Oromo people, who have experienced systematic marginalization and persecution over the last quarter century.\u00a0Authorities have used deadly force[3] against the protesters on more than one occasion. <\/p><p>On October 2 alone, 52 people were killed[4].

He noted that protesters also are free to use city parks from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily, and that the city offered Occupy members meeting space at city libraries.<\/p><p>\"I feel like the city has opened their arms to welcome them,\" Roth said.<\/p><p>The permit was issued one day after a clash between police and the activists, who have gathered here for a weekend event called Occupy the Midwest.<\/p><p>On Friday, Occupy the Midwest organizers took to email and social media to decry what they called \"unprovoked\" and \"violent\" actions by officers Thursday night at Compton Hill Reservoir Park, where some Occupy activists had set up tents for an overnight stay.<\/p><p>Thirteen activists were arrested for general disturbance and violating curfew. Two men remained in custody Friday night on charges of misdemeanor assault, with one of the men also facing a felony charge of unlawful use of a weapon.<\/p><p>\"(Thursday night's) shameful actions by the city of St. Louis should be a wakeup call around the region,\" said AJ Segneri, one of the summit organizers.<\/p><p>Several of those arrested Thursday night were visibly bloodied, a statement issued by the protesters said.

Lawrence O'Toole said officers \"used the least amount of force necessary\" in the arrests.<\/p><p>\"While they may be protesting exercising their constitutional rights, they don't have a right to violate the rights of anybody else,\" O'Toole said. \"They were not doing as they were asked to do. They were blocking the street and causing a disturbance. That's what resulted in the arrests.\"<\/p><p>No officers were injured, but the window of a police cruiser was smashed. O'Toole said it appeared someone hit the car's windshield with a brick or bat.<\/p><p>\"I believe our response was good, and we had no issues with the 135 other people that were there,\" he said.<\/p><p>The activists continued their protests Friday. About 200 people marched on the Missouri Botanical Garden to show opposition to biotech giant Monsanto Co., a sponsor of the attraction. That march, which began at Tower Grove Park, went off without a hitch, O'Toole said.<\/p><p>Later Friday, about 120 members of the group protested at Peabody Energy on Market Street and others held a vigil outside the St. Louis Justice Center. Others gathered for a \"general assembly\" at Atomic Cowboy in the Grove neighborhood.<\/p><p>Occupy St. Louis member Amanda Chasnoff said the activists will continue to rally through the weekend and have no intent to disrupt St. Patrick's Day activities or any other events.<\/p><p>\"Really, this is an educational conference,\" she said. \"This is not a protest rally where people are trying to tear up the city.\"<\/p><\/body>","628":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">The Free Press issued the following news release:<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Internet users outraged by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to gut Net Neutrality are planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on Thursday, Dec. 7, one week before an expected vote at the FCC. In some cities, protesters will march from Verizon stores to lawmakers' offices.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">The protests will highlight the company's role lobbying to kill rules that prevent telecom giants from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what internet users see and do through discriminatory throttling. Protesters will carry signs calling on their members of Congress to speak out against Verizon's attacks on Net Neutrality and publicly oppose the FCC's plan, which is expected to be released this week.<\/p><p>See the website announcing the protests here: VerizonProtests.com<\/p><p>Ajit Pai's plan is expected to contain a \"total repeal\" of Net Neutrality protections, posing a grave threat to the future of freedom of expression, access to information, and small businesses particularly for communities of color and low income communities.<\/p><p>The December 7 protests represent growing grassroots backlash to the FCC's plan, which polls show is wildly unpopular with people from across the political spectrum. The events are supported by Team Internet, a grassroots network of nearly half a million volunteer activists spearheaded by Demand Progress, Fight for the Future, and Free Press Action Fund, three of the groups behind the massive July 12 Net Neutrality day of action that drove millions of comments, emails, and phone calls to the FCC and Congress.<\/p><p>Over recent months the groups behind the protests have organized thousands of constituents to attend more than 600 town halls and meetings with lawmakers to demand their support for Net Neutrality. A phone call campaign through BattleForTheNet.com has generated nearly 250,000 phone calls to legislators offices.<\/p><p>At the protests participants will be encouraged to take a group photo and tweet it at their local members of Congress. Where possible, protesters will march to a nearby lawmaker's office and deliver petition signatures.<\/p><p>Protests are currently planned in Phoenix, Denver, San Francisco, New York City, Indianapolis, Boston, and several other cities across the country. They're being organized by volunteers in a grassroots manner using email, texting, and social media. Local internet users can volunteer to host a protest, and then connect with other volunteers in their area and encourage them to attend. There will be a special protest event in Washington, DC, details are TBA.<\/p><p>\"This is the free speech fight of our generation and internet users are pissed off and paying attention\" said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, \"Ajit Pai may be owned by Verizon, but he has to answer to Congress, and lawmakers have to answer to us, their constituents. The corrupt bureaucrats trying to kill Net Neutrality are hoping to avoid public backlash by burying the news over the Holiday weekend. We're taking our protest from the internet to the streets to make sure that doesn't happen,\" she added.<\/p><p>\"FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has been too busy meeting with industry lobbyists and greedy Verizon executives to hear the outcry from millions of people who are joining together to reject his plan to kill off Net Neutrality,\" said Free Press Action Fund Field Director Mary Alice Crim. \"People know that the open internet is essential for accessing everything from elder care to mental health services and they're willing to fight for it. That's why Team Internet members have met face-to-face with hundreds of members of Congress and their staff, organized others in their communities, and spoken out on behalf of Net Neutrality. This momentum of popular support will spill into the streets on Dec. 7 as people protest Pai and his corporate cronies outside Verizon stores nationwide. Our message to Pai and Verizon is clear: people everywhere will not sit idle as you destroy the free and open internet.\"<\/p><p>\"Americans are sick and tired of lawmakers placing the profits of monopolistic companies like Verizon and Comcast above the interests of ordinary people,\" said Mark Stanley, Director of Communications for Demand Progress. \"Outside Washington, support for strong Net Neutrality is widespread, regardless of political affiliation. Now, with what would be a catastrophic vote by the FCC to repeal Net Neutrality looming, people are ready to take to the streets in protest and to offer Congress one last chance to answer the question: 'Do you stand for your constituents' ability to communicate and connect, or do you stand for Verizon's bottom line?'\"<\/p><p>This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 21, 2017.<\/p><p>Contact: Timothy Karr, 201\/533-8838<\/p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services<\/p><p>MSTRUCK-6083739 MSTRUCK<\/p><\/body>","281":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">The ongoing protests in central Kiev calling for political reforms are unlikely to lead to another Maidan and the overthrow of <person><nameText>President Petro Poroshenko <\/nameText><\/person>because the organisers did not really want this and their slogans were vague, a Ukrainian journalist has written. The following is the text of an article by Tetyana Danylenko, entitled \"Synthetic Maidan\", published by the influential Ukrainian analytical newspaper Zerkalo Nedeli weekly on 21 October 2017; subheads have been added editorially:<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">On the evening of 16 October, the government quarter was flooded with law enforcement officers.<\/p><p>The National Guard, the police and people in civilian clothes surrounded every intersection in the vicinity of the presidential administration. There was special tension in the air. Usually, if the streets are blocked because of emergency measures, the police still let the residents of the government quarter and people working there go home. But this time, nervous officers of the special services were roaming around each police post, making calls to somewhere about every car, shouting at the police and allowing only very expensive cars to pass: individual Maseratis, Porsches, Bentleys, etc. breached the cordon. Bankova Street itself was guarded by tight rows of people wearing black helmets, who lined up on both sides of the street. They also filled the internal yards of the presidential administration. National Guardsmen drilled silently in complete darkness in the yard at the former October Palace on Instytutska Street. Although the Main Information Policy Department of the presidential office attributed these unprecedented security measures to the upcoming visit of the president of Malta, there was nothing like this turmoil and nothing like this number of law enforcers during the recent visit of the president of Turkey, or even during the parade on Independence Day.<\/p><p>MPs from the presidential faction hinted off the record that they were afraid of surprises related to use of force from the former Georgian president [Mikheil] Saakashvili, who was allegedly planning to enter the Supreme Council [parliament] at the height of the upcoming protests and demand something from MPs. None of the MPs could really explain how exactly such a visit would threaten MPs. At about the same time, several hundred metres away from the Supreme Council, activists of the National Corps, the Freedom party and the Right Sector seized without resistance the helicopter landing pad of [ex-<person><nameText>President Viktor] Yanukovych. <\/nameText><\/person>Nationalists immediately assured that the event was in no way connected with the upcoming protest, some media described it as the seizure of the \"post, telegraph and telephone\": the biggest Ukrainian data centre is located on the territory of the site, which is still owned by structures of the \"Family\" [of <person><nameText>Viktor Yanukovych] <\/nameText><\/person>and which serves the government quarter. In addition to that, the media assured people that the protesters could be accommodated on the site if the rally drags on for a long time.<\/p><p>Not enough people for mass rally<\/p><p>At the rally that was held on 17 October, everybody was mixed up: activists of the participating parties, activists and NGOs, politically active retirees, members of the Automaidan, real veterans of the Anti-Terrorist Operation and people dressed like them, fans of Saakashvili, paid flag bearers and ideological youth. Georgians busily wandered in the crowd and whispered something to people in black with the chevrons of the Donbass battalion. According to the organisers, the rally \"For a Great Political Reform\" gathered about five thousand people. However, the number of participants was three thousand, according to police estimates. No matter how many people were stopped at the entrance to Kiev, it was not really a mass rally. At certain moments on the second and the third day of protests the number of participants did not much exceed the number of police and National Guard officers near the Supreme Council. \"The big political reform\" from the Euro-optimists contained three points: withdrawal of parliamentary immunity, changes in the election laws and the introduction of an Anti-Corruption Court. The \"Carthage\" chat room that scared many people with its name, was created not long before the rally thanks to [MP] Mustafa Nayem. Activists, MPs and non-parliamentary parties started to discuss in due time in this chat the anti-corruption agenda and the removal of immunity from MPs Borys Rosenblat, Mykhaylo Dobkin and Maksym Polyakov.<\/p><p>Which Carthage was meant to be destroyed was long forgotten. However, it seems that everybody at the rally near the Supreme Council [parliament]) had their own personal one. While the MPs who organised the rally discussed with colleagues from the pro-government factions which laws should be introduced to parliament for consideration at the conciliation board, Mikheil Saakashvili was actively recommending the resignation of Petro Poroshenko on the streets and wondered why reform demands did not include an impeachment procedure. In the end, it surprised even Oleh  Lyashko, whom [opposition leader] Yuliya Tymoshenko called the president's Chihuahua the same day. \"We all live in a matrix of Poroshenko, his political reality, and only respond to the challenges of the authorities. However, the most important skill in politics is to seize the initiative,\" MP Svitlana Zalishchuk said, explaining the selection of demands for the rally. The idea was that the pro-government factions would not be able to abandon their own campaign promises. However, it was always unlikely that all of them would be kept, and even more so, at once. Therefore, the Euro-optimists planned to hold on to the initiative for a long time and keep this agenda in focus, actualising it with waves in social media and street actions.<\/p><p>\"We are from the Seventh Kilometre [market] in Odessa. To enter the market and get a sales point, you have to pay over 200,000 dollars, plus monthly fees. This money goes directly to Yuriy Yenakiyevskyy [nickname of former MP Yuriy Ivanyushchenko] exactly since the date when he illegally took over this market when Yanukovych was in office. But when Yanukovych fled and the new authorities came, nothing changed. We still pay the Yanukovych gang!\" two decently dressed men said as they followed MP Serhiy Leshchenko along Hrushevskoho Street, describing why they came to the rally. They assured that they will support the protest to the last, because they are fed up. Somewhere nearby women of retirement age, who participated in the rally as well, held a secular conversation about politics. They were in no hurry and argued about the role of Saakashvili, who appeared near the parliament building like a hurricane.<\/p><p>He shouted from the stage, ran around the rally, embraced people and disappeared for a long time. Women differed in their assessment of him as a politician, but they agreed that \"only Misha has the boldness to remove Poroshenko\".<\/p><p>On Thursday [19 October] evening, a small procession led by Mikheil Saakashvili went in the direction of Bankova Street [presidential administration]. [Opposition Self-reliance MPs] Yehor Sobolyev and Semen Semenchenko walked alongside Saakashvili. The procession shouted revolutionary chants that remained unchanged from the time of Ukraine Without Kuchma protest, sang the national anthem and called for Poroshenko [to come out]. Just some two hundred metres from the presidential administration, Saakashvili got into a black Mercedes and left without explanation. The MPs looked at each other in astonishment, but moved on to pass a draft law on an anti-corruption court to the presidential administration.<\/p><p>Protest slogans not appealing to public<\/p><p>Does this look like the Maidan and revolution? Hardly. The slogans are difficult to understand even to most of the organisers, let alone ordinary people. Nobody came up with or even groped new slogans that could be relevant to the obvious public demand for protest. In addition to that, the implementation of voiced requirements does not guarantee the achievement of these goals. Limitation of immunity is no guarantee against political corruption, because the government, head of state administrations, military and police officers, officials of various levels and oligarchs, for example, do not have immunity. So what? The dreamed of introduction of open electoral lists will unlikely eliminate buying of votes, paid journalism or black PR. And the appearance of the anti-corruption court, even with additional selection criteria, would not mean that the courts will instantly become a mecca of judicial conscience and professionalism. Yes, we should strive for changing the rules, but we hardly should idealise the results of these changes.<\/p><p>In the meantime, \"competition within the framework of partnership\" between the dozen or so various organisers of the protest for reforms just miraculously failed to grow to a punchfest. Saakashvili's people hinted that the revolution was disrupted by the nationalists, who signed up for the rally, but failed to mobilise even a third of people who came to march on the Feast of the Intercession [refers to torchlit march in Kiev on 14 October, marked in Ukraine as Day of Defenders of Ukraine]. Nationalists, who develop massive idiosyncrasy over everything that is connected with the former president of Georgia, called their contribution to the action excessive and undervalued. The Euro-optimists were irritated by the lack of discrimination of the first, the unpredictability of the second, and the radical expectations of all the others. Other participants had their claims. Everyone was disappointed with each other in this alliance. However, organisational issues are not everything.<\/p><p>The rhetorical question hung in the air: what is this? It is a claim for a Maidan? Why all of a sudden?<\/p><p>Society swallowed the unsolved crimes of the Maidan, the preservation of old corrupt schemes and the birth of new, no less arrogant ones. Society swallowed bloody military defeats, diplomatic miscalculations, destruction of the largest military depots. People swallowed and forgot the fire in the camp that was opened by the president with great fanfare and where children burnt several months later, because all funds allocated for the fire safety system were completely embezzled. It would be absurd if, after all this, against the backdrop of a real impoverishment of even those people who are not badly off, a real Maidan broke out under the slogans of cancelling immunity and open electoral lists, the evergreen topics in Ukrainian politics. This list was supplemented by the Anticorruption Court which is a mystery for everyone.<\/p><p>Prospects for new wave of protests<\/p><p>The call for a Maidan failed. After all, none of the organisers sincerely wanted to do this.<\/p><p>For the firewood of the potential protest seemed too raw for anyone to dream of a big fire. Revolutionary idealists do not yet know how exactly they could ignite the hearts of dissatisfied citizens. And the revolutionary cynics still have enough smoke, from the leisurely burning of protest brushwood. Petro Oleksiyovych [Poroshenko] is costing the sponsors of some leaders too much to avoid dreaming of his premature replacement. [Sentence translated as received] That is why they will continue to make smoke, hoping to smoke him out.<\/p><p>However, even minor combustion was enough to make the president's fears visible. The hysterics of the authorities over anything that even remotely resembles what led those authorities to power is very obvious. And it leaves no less of an aftertaste than the fragmentation of the opposition and narcissism of some of its leaders. Despite all the clumsiness of the latest abortive Maidan, some benefits can be detected: the authorities must be stirred from time to time not to feel complete impunity.<\/p><p>Is a new protest wave possible? Completely. Protest sentiments, as Ukrainian experience shows, have the ability to accumulate in order to break out on an unprecedented scale. And then nobody will care what Poroshenko and [Prime Minister Arsen] Avakov suspect each other of and what the role of [tycoon Ihor] Kolomoyskyy in this protest is.<\/p><p>Will politicians be able to influence the process? Yes, provided that they do not only engage in self-promotion, but also search for new meanings. Who would have inspired hope in a country where the authorities now reliably guarantee everyone only one right. The right to leave the country.<\/p><p>But millions of people from different segments of the ideological spectrum are ready to pass this right to flee to the current authorities.<\/p><p>Source: Zerkalo Nedeli in Russian 21 Oct 17<\/p><\/body>","410":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Coca-Cola workers in three Chinese cities have gone on strike following the company\u2019s announcement that it will sell off its bottling operations in the country.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">The company announced that it will divest its bottling stakes in China last Thursday between Swire Beverage Holdings Ltd. and China Foods Ltd., part of state-owned COFCO.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Workers protesting at the Coca-Cola factory in Chengdu.

Other high-profile, right-wing protests include burning NFL jerseys, writing \"Trump\" on Starbucks cups, and cutting up Nordstrom credit cards.

Often, some people on social media take these protests in absurd directions \u2014 as\u00a0in the case of Keurig smashing or writing \"Trump\" on coffee cups. However, many\u00a0boycotts also\u00a0have concrete business implications, as in the case of the NFL's declining ratings.\u00a0 Here's an overview of\u00a0what happens when the right decides to boycott a brand. NFL Warr DogzAfter\u00a0more than a year of NFL players sitting and kneeling\u00a0during the national anthem,[4]\u00a0controversy over protests reached a tipping point when in September <person><nameText>President Trump <\/nameText><\/person>called for the protesting players to be suspended or fired.\u00a0 Many conservatives backed Trump in his call for a boycott, some showing\u00a0their support of the president \u2014 and their anger at players \u2014 by burning their teams' merchandise.\u00a0 While the fans burning merchandise seem to be a vocal minority, the scandal does seem to be impacting the NFL. Ratings are down this season and, earlier this month, Papa John's said that the controversy\u00a0had led the company to\u00a0consider ending[5]\u00a0its sponsorship deal with the league.\u00a0Amazon Brendan McDermid\/ReutersAmazon has faced boycott threats from both the right and left over the past year.\u00a0 In February,\u00a0Amazon\u00a0announced it would support\u00a0Washington State in a federal lawsuit challenging <person><nameText>President Trump's <\/nameText><\/person>executive order barring people from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the US.\u00a0 Soon after, angry customers began voicing their anger over Amazon's \"anti-Trump agenda\" on social media and promising to boycott the ecommerce giant.[6]\u00a0In June, Trump tweeted that the \"Amazon Washington Post\" is \"FAKE NEWS.\"\u00a0Starbucks Stephen Brashear\/GettyIn February, some Starbucks customers\u00a0threatened to boycott the coffee giant after its CEO took a stand against President <person><nameText>Donald Trump's <\/nameText><\/person>executive order barring immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the US. This wasn't the first time people on the right pulled Starbucks into a protest. In late 2016, alt-right Twitter user\u00a0Baked Alaska[7]\u00a0challenged his 123,000 followers to go to Starbucks and tell the employees that their names are Trump.\u00a0According to Baked Alaska, the purpose of asking baristas to write \"Trump\" on cups is to \"trigger SJW\" employees (SJW is an abbreviation for social justice warrior, a derogatory term for feminists and progressives). And, in late 2015, <person><nameText>Donald Trump <\/nameText><\/person>encouraged boycotting the chain while campaigning.\u00a0 \"Did you read about Starbucks?

normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.dissidentvoice.org\">http:\/\/www.dissidentvoice.org<\/url> Delivered by Newstex)<br\/> Writing in the New York Times in 2008, former US National Security Advisor Zbigniew Bzrezinski stated[1]:<br\/> Though U.S. leadership has been essential to global stability and development, the cumulative effects of national self indulgence, financial irresponsibility, an unnecessary war and ethical transgressions have discredited that leadership. Making matters worse is the global economic crisis.<\/p><p><br\/> The resulting challenge is compounded by issues such as climate, health and social inequality - issues that are becoming more contentious because they have surfaced in the context of what I call 'the global political awakening'.<br\/> For the first time in history almost all of humanity is politically activated, politically conscious and politically interactive. Global activism is generating a surge in the quest for cultural respect and economic opportunity in a world scarred by memories of colonial or imperial domination.<br\/> The 'global activism' referred to above is represented by the myriad, corporate NGOs that agitate for 'human rights', 'environmentalism', 'action against hunger', and so on. What Brzezinski's article announced was a new era of US smart power where good causes would be harnessed by agencies working for the military industrial complex in order to assure the continuation and furtherance of US hegemony in the world. The result was a series of colour revolutions and humanitarian wars in North Africa and the Middle East and now the current ongoing destabilization of Brazil. In the same article, Brzezinski warns that 'the only alternative to a constructive American role is global chaos'.<br\/> This is precisely what we are beginning to see throughout the world as countries refusing to submit to the New World Order are being destabilized with anarchistic and rhizomatic social movements, funded by imperialism.<br\/> We have already referred to Guido Mantega's comments about a currency war between the United States and Brazil. No diplomatic official of any state has ever declared war on the US government since the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in 1943. While Mantega accused the US of starting a currency war, it is highly probable that Wall Street would see Brazil's determination to defend its interests as an attack on US imperialism.<br\/>Brazil has traditionally been referred to as a 'America's sleeping giant' due to the country's enormous economic potential.The quotation, attributed to Japanese commander Isoroku Yamamoto after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour when he said, 'I fear we have awakened a sleeping giant and filled him with a terrible resolve', is worth bearing in mind here. A few months after Mantega's declaration of a currency war, anti-corruption protests began to erupt in many of Brazil's cities.<br\/> One of the slogans used in the Brazil demonstrations was 'Brazil has woken up'. In 2011 British beverage corporation Diageo made a commercial for Johnny Walker Whiskey in which a mountain erupts into a giant, inspiring the population to walk with him. The commercial was highly successful and bore the caption, 'O Gigante nao esta adormecido' - the giant is no longer asleep, which became one of the slogans of the social protest movement that erupted in June 2013.<br\/> In April of 2013, Diageo made another commercial for Johnny Walker, with the caption 'esta na hora na prossimo passo' - it's time for the next step. Diageo has claimed that the use of its commercials by the protest movement in Brazil was a mere coincidence but this is unlikely, given the highly organized, professional and coordinated presence [2]of other US 'regime change' NGOs operating throughout Brazil.<br\/> Previous US backed 'colour revolution' movements have made use of alcohol to incite violence and unrest. For example, the US backed putchists who attempted to foment a coup in Belarus in 2010, attacking the parliament with iron bars, were heavily under the influence of alcohol. During the Brazil protests, government buildings were attacked by protestors, such as the Itamaraty Palace, home of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, a building designed by the great communist architect Oscar Neimayer, who had to flee Brazil in 1964, when a similar 'revolution' brought fascist generals to power.<br\/> The Brazilian government's decision to defend its interests in a currency war with the United States was tantamount to a financial Pearl Harbor. The 'sleeping giant' that would erupt throughout Brazil could be described as US intelligence working through Brazil's disgruntled petite-bourgeoisie and directed against the protectionist state.<br\/> 'Come to the Street' says Fiat motor company<br\/> Another TV commercial, whose predictive programming is even more explicit than the Johnny Walker advertisement, came from Fiat motor company. The highly emotive Fiat commercial bore the caption 'Vem pra Rua' and showed scenes of mass demonstrations with demonstrators stretching their hands in the air. The stretched hands image features as the logo of many US regime change organizations such as 'The World Movement for Demoracy'. The Fiat commercial was ostensibly made to coincide with celebrations of the Confederations Cup; this is evident in the video. It therefore cannot be proved that the video was intended to encourage anti-government demonstrations. Nevertheless, the suspicion remains.<br\/> Fiat Uno, Strade, Siena and Palio are some of the most popular cars among Brazil's new highly indebted petite-bourgeoisie, the very class that would take to the streets in June chanting in unison 'vem pra rua[3]!'- come to the streets!.<br\/>Fiat has been highly successful in Brazil over the years where it has broken production and sales records. But production declined sharply in 2012 leading the company into negotiations with the Metal Workers Union to lay off workers. The PT government has put pressure on companies not to lay off workers; this contrasts markedly with the behavior of the military regime, which ruled the country exclusively on behalf of multinational companies.<br\/>Fiat recently merged with General Motors in Brazil. Since last year, GM has faced pressure from President Dilma Rousseff to retain workers[4] in exchange for tax breaks that helped lift sales in the world's fourth-largest car market to a record high in 2012.<br\/> There is nothing multinational corporations hate more than collective bargaining. In spite of the fact that most unions in capitalist countries function more like guardsmen in wage-slavery concentration camps, the fact that international corporate executives have to deal with unions when 'restructuring' their companies according to the market forces is something most corporations would prefer to do away with as part of modernization and 'change we can believe in'.<br\/> In 2011 Reuters reported[5] that Fiom, the Italian metal workers union 'accused the carmaker of reneging on investment pledges and turning back the clock on labour relations to the 19th century'.<br\/>Fiat's CEO Sergio Marchionne, lent his support to the EU-installed technocrat Mario Monti saying Italy had 'a once in a lifetime opportunity to embrace change'.<br\/> Now Brazilians will have an opportunity to embrace 'change' too via 'change Brazil', where the federal state of Brazil will be weakened beyond repair, collective bargaining rights for workers abolished and the good old days of military dictatorship brought back if Marchionne and his ilk gets their way.<br\/> The Brazilian government has given tax breaks to multinational workers on condition that they maintain employment. The goal of the Workers Party was to bring Brazil up to welfare state levels of collective bargaining that existed in Europe in the post-World War Two era. Now that the welfare state in Europe is all but dead, there is no reason why corporations should have to put up with welfare states in the developing world. One can understand why companies like Fiat and General Motors would favour 'regime change' in Brazil.<br\/> Of course, these companies can always rely on plausible denial and claim as they have done that this was all a coincidence. But there are many reasons to doubt such statements when one considers how fascist coups were organized in the 1960s using similar techniques of predictive programming through cinema and the advertising industry, involving the coordinating of hundreds of corporations working in secret.<br\/> Most decisions in capitalist societies are taken by unelected officials behind the doors of board rooms and conference halls, far from the simple world of the petit-bourgeois consumer. The world which people like Soros promote is the very opposite of an open society. It involves the progressive enclosure of physical and mental spaces culminating in the reduction of human existence to the dancing digits of the stock exchange. It was ironic that protests said to be the result of a desire for better public transport used a slogan especially designed for the occasion by a private motor company.<br\/> Peaceful Rio<br\/> In 2011, an NGO called Rio de Paz organized a spectacular protest against corruption on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, where hundreds of broom sticks were pitched in the sand. An article appeared in the Guardian newspaper referring to the nascent protest movement. An article on the movement also appeared on the website of Movements.org. Movements.org is sponsored by Pepsi, Google, and Omnicon Group, who are members of the Council on Foreign Relations. Its director is Jared Cohen, head of Google Ideas. He served as a State Department planning staff member under the Bush and Obama administrations.<br\/> Tony Cartulucci writes[6]:<br\/> Founding Movements.org with Cohen is\u00a0Jason Liebman[7]\u00a0of Howcast Media which works with mega-corporate conglomerates like Proctor Gamble, Kodak, Staples, Ford, and government agencies such as the US State Department and the US Defense Department, to create 'custom branded entertainment, innovative social media, and tardeted rich-media campaigns.' He was also with Google for 4 years where he worked to partner with Time Warner (CFR), News Corporation (FoxNews, CFR) Viacom, Warner Music, Sony Pictures, Reuters, the New York Times, and the Washington Post Company.<br\/> Roman Sunder[8]\u00a0is also credited with co-founding Movements.org. He founded Access 360 Media, a mass advertising company, and he also organized the PTTOW! Summit which brought together 35 top executives from companies like ATT (CFR), Quicksilver, Activison, Facebook, HP, YouTube, Pepsi (CFR), and the US Government to discuss the future of the 'youth industry.' He is also a board member of Gen Next, another non-profit organization focused on 'affecting change for the next generation.<br\/> The 'Youth industry' gave the world the 'Arab Spring' in 2011. It was the left cover for a war of aggression against Libya and Syria and it is now being used by the US State Department in order to prepare the terrain for regime change in Brazil in 2014 or possibly earlier. It would be extremely na\u00efve to believe that the US would simply accept that Brazil and Latin America were no longer going to be their playground. When Mr Change Obama, announced in his 2008 election campaign 'we need to reclaim Latin America'', he meant business; 'Change Brazil' is the result of more than two years of planning.<br\/> The notion of a country suddenly 'awakening' was also promoted during the US backed 'Arab Spring' protests in 2011. This ignores the fact that people have been protesting throughout the Middle East and North Africa against US\/Israeli imperialism for decades. Protests against capitalism are not new to Brazil either. The notion of awakening was adumbrated by the aforementioned former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso in an interview given to The American Interest magazine in 2012. Referring to his time in office during the 1990s, Cardoso said[9]:<br\/> Altogether the more open economy, foreign capital investment, and the busting of monopolies produced a new Brazil, an 'awake' Brazil.'<br\/> No doubt, Cardoso pleased the editors of the American Interest when he assured him that his party would not push for Brazil's inclusion in the UN Security Council. The former Brazilian president noted:<br\/> We have to be more cautious about seeking a seat, however. It is a rather complex question. Now isn't really the time to reform the council.<br\/> This is a clear indication that Cardoso and the clique he represents fully support the Responsibility to Protect Doctrine and will shift policy in favour of Washington if the riots in Brazil help the right-wing opposition to seize power after, or perhaps even before, the presidential elections in 2014.<br\/> The submissive attitude of Cardoso contrasts markedly with the fiery speech given by former Brazilian president Luis Inacia Lula da Silva to the African Union in 2011, when he insisted[10] that Latin America and Africa should have permanent seats in the UN Security Council.<br\/>Citigroup and the CIA<br\/> The chairman of Diageo, the company that made the above mentioned commercial, is Franz Humer, who is also a board member of Citigroup, one of the world's biggest banks. Past board members of Citigroup have included former CIA chief John M. Deutch. According to former Los Angeles Police Department field officer Michel Rupert[11], there has always been a revolving door between Wall Street banks and the Central Intelligence Agency.<br\/>Citigroup relies on Latin America for 21 percent of its assets. In April 2013, the firm decided to exit its hitherto lucrative credit card business in Brazil, which supplied credit cards to the lower middle class, who would make up the majority of the protestors in June. There have been rumours that a major credit card default crisis is looming in Brazil. Citigroup have complained that the Brazilian banking scene is a closed shop with the major Banks controlled by the state. However, Citigroup will continue to maintain a one percent presence in acquisitions and mergers and will provide credit to the country's wealthy elite. State monopoly of Brazil's banking sector has prevented Wall Street banks from taking over the country. Mexico's more 'open economy' allowed Citigroup to purchase its bigger bank in 2001.<br\/> If Citigroup had information that a regime change operation was underway in Brazil to end the 'currency war' and open up the economy to Wall Street penetration, this could explain the sell-off of its credit card business one month before the biggest protest movement Brazil has seen in 20 years, a movement which has caused a state of emergency and could bring down the Rousseff government.<br\/> According to Bloomberg, Brazil's Banco Itau has taken over top rankings[12] in the merger and acquisitions market from Citigroup, Rothshild and Credit Suisse. The Bloomberg report notes[13]:<br\/> Foreign firms are facing more competition from local rivals as they try to hold on to their share of the investment-banking market in Brazil, where an emerging middle class is propelling one of the world's fastest-growing economies.<br\/> It is this rising national bourgeoisie that forms the basis of the Workers Party support, in contrast to the comprador bourgeoisie represented by the likes of former Brazilian central banker Arminio Fraga, a Soros agent, whose private equity and hedge fund Gavea Investimentos Ltda is owned by JP Morgan Chase.<br\/> William Landers, Portfolio Manager of Blackrock's Latin American Investment Trust, PLC told Bloomberg in June that the protests in Brazil were 'what we're looking for'. Black Rock was formed in 1988 by Larry Fink and Robert Kapito, who pioneered the mortgage-backed securities scam that led to the global financial crisis. Blackrock represents the quintessence of casino capitalism and a corporate funded 'people's movement' against the Brazilian state which is very pro-market regulation and is precisely what they want. Landers also praised Dilma Rousseff for supporting[14] the protests.<br\/> Colour Revolution tactics<br\/> One of the tried and tested methods of the CIA-funded Centre for Non Violent Actions and Strategies (CANVAS), an organization which trains youth all over the world to overthrow governments hostile to US interests, involves the wooing of the security forces such as through the distribution of flowers. CANVAS Director Srdjan Popovic told the makers of the documentary\u00a0The Revolution Business how this psychology works when he confirmed that the 'spontaneous' uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt in 2011 were the result of extensive planning by numerous NGOs.<br\/> The Real News Network published a report where they showed protestors handing out flowers to police during the Brazil protests. Other videos showed police sitting down with the protestors. This is classic regime change psychology and indicates the presence of activists linked to CANVAS operating on the ground.<br\/> The Revolution Business documentary also showed how the organizers of the protests staged events in order to escalate tension and violence against the Mubarak regime. One of the most famous of such incidents involved the attack on protestors by thugs riding camels through Tahrir Square.<br\/> A similar event occurred in Rio de Janeiro when a car deliberately raced into a group of protestors, reportedly killing one of them. This report resembles the camel chase psyops in Egypt.<br\/> Although there does seem to be evidence of atrocious police brutality in Brazil, some of the examples dramatized by the corporate media and the fake leftist media are highly reminiscent of the Arab Spring and the 2009 attempted 'Green Revolution' in Iran. For example, the Real News Network reported[15] that 'a couple of videos have circulated on the internet showing a few police officers leaving their weapons and taking the side of protestors'.<br\/> This notion of the security forces 'refusing to kill their own people' is a classic feature of destabilization tactics used by imperialism in the early stages of a regime change operation. In Libya and in Syria, most of these false stories were fabricated by faceless cyber activists collaborating with Western intelligence agencies. There is also the possibility that agents provocateurs and snipers in the Brazilian military police in the service of the CIA, may be attempting to escalate the violence in order to create conditions for a military coup.<br\/> During the 1964 coup that ousted left-leaning Jauo Goulart, US assets in the Brazilian military played a central role in the destabilization of the country. At the outset of the protests in Brazil, the commandant of the Sao Paulo Military Police Benedito Roberto Meira praised the protests.<br\/> A Brazilian communist wrote an excellent analysis[16] of events on the social media website Reddit:<br\/> Now, you're probably asking, 'how can you suggest that the current protests are fascist? You're out of your mind!'. Well you are reading this and you are probably not in Brazil, watching how giddy the media is with the whole thing. You are probably not aware that the agenda against 'corruption' was\u00a0suggested by the military chief of police when negotiating with MPL[17]\u00a0You are also probably not aware that the large majority of the opposition to the Worker's Party does not come from the radical left, as I wish it did, as MPL does, but it comes from PSDB and half of their electors are nostalgic of our fascist dictatorship. So they are going out there and\u00a0asking for a new one[18].<br\/> The sign says 'military intervention now. For the\u00a0democratic\u00a0government of civilians and military' which is, I'm sure, how he remembers the 1964-1986 period to be.<br\/> As I write this, thousands of right wing militants are\u00a0BURNING RED FLAGS[19]\u00a0in Paulista Avenue and demanding the impeachment of Brazilian president Dilma Roussef. These militants are those who think that democracy only exists when married to neoliberalism, so in her place they want to install PSDB or the Brazilian equivalent of Pedro Carmona.'<br\/>Facebook and social media play a key role in colour revolutions. The uprising in Brazil is now being referred to as the Vinegar Uprising or the Vinegar Revolution. The Centre for Non-Violent Actions and Strategies advocates humour and silliness as effective techniques for making authorities look stupid when trying to keep public order in the face of growing protest movement. Colour revolutions usually have famous trigger events.<br\/> In Brazil, one of the trigger events[20] involved the arrest of a journalist who came to protest with vinegar to protect himself from tear gas. Before long, Facebook pages were opened up proclaiming the Vinegar Revolution.<br\/> Another feature of colour revolution strategy is to create distrust of politics among the people. Thus, the slogans tend to be de-politized. One sees, for example, slogans such as 'we are neither left nor right' or 'we want ethic bank' or 'no political parties'. The inculcation of anti-political sentiment works best among sections of the population who have little or no history of political activism. Such people are passive, consume slogans and narratives and are easily manipulated into tuning into the mantra of the nascent group mind, whose essence is ultimately mindlessness. Colour revolutions are about corporate power using the masses to destroy politics. They are social revolts that pre-empt revolution. Instead of waking up the masses, the agencies of colour revolutions put them in a trance.<br\/> 'We don't want foreign doctors! PT- go to Cuba, go to Venezuela!'<br\/> As the protests spread throughout Brazil, the Brazilian and international corporate press suddenly became champions of 'public services' and 'health care'. Many protestors held banners denouncing plans by the Brazilian government to import foreign doctors in order to cope with major staff shortages in the health care system.<br\/>Cuba is widely considered to have one of the best health care systems in the world and the country sends doctors all over the world. The Brazilian government has plans to employ 6000 doctors[21] to work in Brazil's poor regions. Brazil's foreign minister Antonio Patriota has admitted Cuba's superiority in medicine and pharmaceutical research telling reporters:<br\/>Cuba is highly proficient in the areas of medicine, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology and Brazil is considering receiving Cubans doctors in talks that involve PAHO.<br\/> Malaria is still a major cause of death in Brazil, a disease that has been eradicated in Cuba.<br\/>Cuba also has the best education system in Latin America and arguably one of the best systems in the entire Western Hemisphere. In 2001 international experts were so shocked by the high level of education when they conducted research in the country that they sent the research team back to verify and make sure the results were correct.<br\/> Cooperation in science and education between Cuba and Brazil has increased[22] since Dilma Rousseff was elected president. There are many Cuban academics teaching courses in Brazilian universities and Cuban expertise has been solicited in order to increase Brazil's proficiency in mathematics and science.<br\/>Brazil has also invested in Cuba, developing the Muriel port outside Havana, set to become the hub of a new free-trade zone with the rest of Latin America.<br\/> This is a development which Brazil's reactionary oligarchs and their American allies want to stop.<br\/> The employment of Cuban doctors and academics in Brazil is an admission by the Brazilian government that neoliberal capitalism cannot solve the problems of society. It proves the superiority of socialist societies. The presence of Cuban doctors and academics in Brazil is a tremendous opportunity for the left to show the people that popular democracy based in the Cuban model is the only way to end poverty and create an open, inclusive and free society. Cuba can show Brazilians that they too could have a country where no children sleep on the street, where social violence is minimal and where culture, education and human development is prioritized over the greed of the few.<br\/> 'We want better public services- run by private companies'<br\/> In a revealing essay, 'Why Brazil is an Emerging Market Economy', Sean Williams argues:<br\/> Some economists argue that the negative effects of inequality are compounded in countries where the people with the money are also the people with the political power. The argument assumes that wealthy politicians are more likely to underfund basic public services (education, housing, public transportation, etc.) that they themselves do not use or need, to lower their own tax burden. These economists suggest that if instead they provided those basic public services, more citizens would be able to participate effectively in the national economy, which would increase growth and widen the tax base, opening the possibility of lowering the tax burden on the wealthy. In other words, all sectors of society would share the benefit of equal economic participation.<br\/> While this may sound progressive, what the author is arguing for here is privatization of public services, which as he contends, would result in 'lowering the tax burden on the wealthy'.<br\/> The privatization of all public services is part of the Washington Consensus and is currently being implemented in developed countries through austerity programmes; that is why the US regime change organizations operating in Brazil are focusing on'public services' such as education, health, and transport.<br\/> While these sectors of the economy are by no means perfect, tremendous progress has been made since 2003 in improving health, education and transport. OECD statistics show, for example, that the percentage of GDP spent on education under the PT government has increased significantly. Public spending on education increased from 10.5 % of total public expenditure in 2000 to 14.5% in 2009, which was the highest increase among 33 countries surveyed by the OECD study. Brazil ranks first among 29 countries surveyed for its increase in expenditure per student. There has been a major focus on primary and secondary education where expenditure rose from 149% from 2005 - 2009. While serious investment is needed in tertiary education, Brazil has seen the highest increase in education spending of all countries surveyed by the OECD.<br\/> In contrast to the United States, Brazilian health care, transportation and education are publicly funded and the Brazilian constitution bars foreign investors from investing in health and aviation.<br\/> However, right wing mayor of Sao Paulo Gerardo Alkmin, whose PSDB party are supporting the protest movement, has been one of the most notorious advocates of privatization of the health and transport system.<br\/> Alkmin has been pushing for the privatization of the Sao Paulo metro system, which in spite of all the press brouhaha about the state of public services in Brazil, is considered to be[23] one of the best and cleanest metro systems in the world, according to ISO9001 quality management standards published by the International Management for Standardization.<br\/> Many commentators also ignored the improvements in transport in Brazil's favelas such as the cable cars provided by the state[24] for Alemao Favela in Rio, projects which have greatly improved the lives of Brazil's poor.<br\/> The recent protests triggered by management of the transport system are not new. On the Global Voices website[25] there is an article about a protest that was organized in Sao Paulo in upper class Higienopolis district over a controversy which erupted when locals objected to a new metro station claiming it would lead to an influx of delinquents into the area.<br\/> An event called 'Churascao da Gente Differenciada' was organized by Facebook activists on May 14, 2011 to protest against 'elitism'. The event was attended by right-wing former major of Sao Paulo and former presidential candidate Jose Serra. 'Citizen' reporters published videos of the event online.<br\/> The Global Voices website is funded by Reuters, MacCarthur, UNFPA and Berkman. The Berkman Centre for Internet and Society is a Harvard based research centre, which collaborates with the US Department of State in 'democracy' promotion throughout the world. Its activities include training for 'internet reporters' and 'civil engagement'. Anyone who knows anything about the history of US training and support for death squads, torture and genocide throughout Latin America will know what US State Department funded 'civil engagement' means.<br\/> The focus and orientation of the recent protests has been to exaggerate the problems with public services in Brazil, when, in fact, public services have improved, albeit slightly, under the PT government.<br\/> As if predicting the transport hike protests the Economist magazine[26] published a report in March 31st 2013 entitled 'Sao Paulo's Metro, Not Yet Fit for A Metropolis', where it suggested that 'private investment' was needed to improve the service, while ignoring the fact that the state run service in a developing country is, as aforementioned, considered to be world class. The Economist article also referred to the Barbecue Protests.<br\/> Gerardo Alcmin has also advocated the wholesale privatization of airports in Brazil. Since the economic boom, Brazil's aviation industry has increased steadily every year averaging at over 9 percent and is expected to treble in the next 20 years. The aviation industry in Brazil is state owned and this has irked foreign investors who want to profit from one of Latin America's major growth industries. Investment U magazine says[27] the aviation industry should be privatized and that the state-run Infraero is 'dominated by public sector unions and 'focuses more on jobs than results'; 'results' here in investor language means 'profits'.<br\/> The Economist notes:<br\/> In the 1990s a centrist government offloaded energy, telecoms and mining firms. But its left-wing successors stopped privatizations.<br\/> Although Guarulhos, Sao Paulo's main international airport, was partly privatized in Feb 2012, the Economist magazine remarks[28]:<br\/> Sceptics have wondered if the price was so high because the government was dealing with itself. The consortium that won Guarulhos was led by the pension funds of Petrobras, a giant oil company, and Banco do Brasil, the country's biggest bank. Both firms are state-controlled. And BNDES, the state development bank, will finance the deal.<br\/> No Investment in Favelas?<br\/> Another example of the demand for public institutions provided by private companies comes from a CNN report on the July 11th protests. The CNN report quotes a resident, Souza, from Paraisopolis favela in Sao Paolo who says[29]:<br\/> The only ones who do something for us are the businesses. We don't have hospitals. The only place where we can take our children is the Einstein, a community program that is privately financed. When I ask for a visit, they give me an appointment in three months or more.<br\/> Only private business can provide public services; the message is clear. The Albert Einstein Jewish hospital funds a 'social assistance' programme in the area. Many of the residents in Paraisopolis come from the agricultural regions of Northern Brazil, where the government is attempting to construct a hydroelectric dam that would transform the economy of the region, enabling many of the residents in Paraisopolis to return to their homelands. The Belo Monte dam is opposed by the US government.<br\/> The US Institute for International Development[30], a front organization for the CIA according to former agency officer John Stockwell, has been working in the Paraisopolis area since 2006 promoting 'sustainable' electricity. It may also have had a hand in promoting 'sustainable' anti-government protests!<br\/>Paraisopolis is not a particularly good example of the incompetence of the Brazilian government. There has been a major drive since 2002 to create new social housing and infrastructure in the area. The Venezuelan firm Caracas Urban Think Tank, a specialist in the development of slum towns, was recently invited by the municipal government to design social housing, schools and parks in the area.<br\/> Caracas Urban Think Tank has been constructing successful social infrastructure projects in Venezuela and the Brazilian government hopes[31] to make Paraisopolis a showcase of experimental sites.<br\/> Citiscope magazine recently published[32] a report entitled 'No Excuses Slum Upgrading - In fast-urbanizing planet, Sao Paulo develops model toolkit to improve housing for poor, dispossessed'. Investigative journalists Fernando Serpone Bueno and Veridiana Saleh reported that urban development in the Sao Paulo slum has improved 'light years' since the US backed military dictatorship in the 1980s. The Lula administration established the Municipal Housing Council. Since then, the Paraisopolis favela has seen major improvements in the provision of clean water and public amenities. The Municipal Housing Council is elected by the local people and has an input into how government money is spent. Elliot Sclar, Director of Columbia University's Sustainable Urban Development, has described the Paraisopolis development as an 'exemplar'.<br\/> While there is still an enormous amount of work to be done in improving the lives of Brazil's poor, the representation offered by the corporate press in order to prop up their regime-change protests is far from the social reality.<br\/> There has been a lot of moralization by the corporate press about a country with high inequalities holding the World Cup. This ignores the fact that huge investments by the Brazilian government as well as major job creation are being boosted by preparations for the games. In fact, Brazilian minister for Sport and communist party leader Aldo Rebelo promised soccer fans [33]that World Cup tickets would be the cheapest in history and reconstruction of sports facilities is not being undertaken with federal money.<br\/> Instead of cheering on protests organized by imperialism, leftists should be questioning their purpose and orientation. Just because na\u00efve, lower middle class youth are holding up banners calling for 'better public services' and cheaper transport does not mean they are fighting against capitalism and globalization. Their capitalist training centres and financial backers believe that privately run public services are better and this is what the people of Brazil will get if imperialism succeeds in 'regime change' next year, and if the left doesn't abandon its silly dogma that the 'masses make history' and devise strategies to counteract imperialism's new 'people powered' anti-politics.<br\/> Curitiba - The solution to Brazil's 'public services' problem<br\/> The city of Curitiba in Parana state in Brazil is considered by many to be one of the best planned and most sustainable cities in the world. American geographers, urban designers, architects and policy researchers consider Curitiba's privately run Integrated Bus Transit System to be one of the most efficient in the world and a model for 21st century urban transport provision.<br\/> However, Clara Irazabal shows in her book City Making And Urban Governance in the Americas: Curitiba and Portland, that the city's much vaunted image of progress masks a far from positive reality of poverty, social exclusion and technocratic tyranny. While the bus system does have some merits, cost-cutting has led to poor training for personnel, overcrowding and poor quality service. There is little motivation to improve services as public transport is only used by the poor and, as they have no means of exerting pressure on the super-rich, faceless technocrats who rule the city according to their financial interests.<br\/> The city's former mayor and 'star-architect' Jaime Lerner has been interviewed[34] by Brazil's corporate press since the protests in order to solicit his expertise in solving the country's 'public services' problems.<br\/> Lerner was a member of the right-wing ARENA party during the fascist dictatorship. He sits on the board of the World Resources Institute, which is funded by Citigroup, and is an associate of Bill Clinton.<br\/> As mayor of Curitiba he oversaw a privatization programme that reduced large swathes of the population to poverty, with workers losing all of the rights they gained in the 1943 Work Codification Law.<br\/> When Lerner ran Curitiba, Irazabal writes:<br\/> The planning process produced favoured elites and -perhaps unintentionally- institutionalized or, worse yet, promoted inequality. Finally, there is the perverse possibility that aggressive and well-tailored media campaigns effectively coerced lower-income classes to suppress their own class-based social practices of appreciation and appropriation of space. Moreover, such campaigns may have led people to assimilate patterns of spatial appreciation and appropriation characteristic of other social classes.<br\/> Most of the population was completely excluded from the city's planning process. The city's poor were regulated to the periphery and due to the rising prices of real estate found themselves forced to move farther outside the cities where they set up shantytowns that had no water or sanitation.<br\/>Curitiba is run by a closely knit business oligarchy obsessed with increasing their own power and wealth while regulating the lives of the citizens they control.<br\/> Irazabel writes:<br\/> Citizen participation was and still is conceived by the leaders as the level of identification with and appropriation of the urban landscape by its inhabitants. In accordance with this notion, citizens are perceived and treated solely as consumers of urban goods, and the city is increasingly treated and portrayed as a commodity.<br\/> Western scholars portray Curitba as having Brazil's highest standard of living. However, official statistics in Brazil show that it only ranks 12th overall!<br\/> Irazabel's book also reveals how previous mayors have attempted to disguise the city's shanty towns for international ecology conferences; how they have used alcohol for tourists buses in order to create the impression that the city uses 'clean energy' and how aggressive media propaganda which promotes Curitiba as an 'ecological' city has brainwashed many of its own citizens into believing that the naked emperor wears golden robes.<br\/> Multinational corporations have a free hand in Curitiba. For example, Renault decided it wanted to set up its plant in an environmentally protected area which was supposed to supply the city with water. The corrupt authorities allowed Renault to take over the most ecological part of the city which was renamed 'Ecological Industrial Zone'. Henceforth, water would have to be found elsewhere.<br\/> Irazabal shows how leaders of social movements combating the oligarchy has been bought off and how the Shantytown poor have been brainwashed into thinking that the flashy buildings they see in the distance actually represent their city, even though many of them have never been in the wealthy city centre.<br\/> Social problems such as lack of affordable housing, deficient education and health services, and increases in crime, violence, homelessness, and unemployment have burgeoned in a neglected suburban environment, and have become critical signs of a rapidly deteriorating urban environment\u2026groups of the popular movements that remain organized, in particular around issues of housing, education and health, are also opposed to these trends. These groups, however, been either dispersed or not large, mature, resilient, and\/or politically savvy enough to effectively contest these processes.<br\/> The privatization of everything and the enslavement of the poor; this is what the Western power elite mean when they talks about 'smart cities'.<br\/> The Deceptive nature of Fascism<br\/> Given the increasing risk of a return of fascism to Brazil through the CIA-backed destabilization campaign through the 'anti-corruption' movement, it is important to examine some aspects of this extreme right wing ideology.<br\/> During the 1930s, fascism arose as a response to the real 'awakening' of the working class who were organizing themselves in unions and demanding their rights. The success of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry in the Soviet Union, which was industrializing apace; the militancy of the working class movement led by highly organized and united communist parties; and the fact that the capitalist system had collapsed since the Wall Street crash of 1928, all of these factors meant that the only way for finance capitalism to prevent social revolution was to create counter-movements that would appeal to the masses by appropriating left wing discourse and redirecting it in favour of corporate interests. The result was fascism. Fascism is the attempt by the ruling class to mobilise the petite-bourgeoise and the working class to the cause of the ruling class by deceiving them.<br\/> It is an attempt to prevent social revolution by diverting the hatred of the workers for their capitalist bosses towards hatred of scapegoats. To do this, it appropriates left-wing discourse and symbology, infusing it with new meaning. Thus, in Nazi Germany, capitalism became 'revolutionary' in the form of 'national socialism', where the Jew and not the capitalist became the enemy of the people, while the hammer and sickle of the communists was replaced by the Swastika, which was inspired by the tyrannical regime of the Lamas in Tibet, whose brutal feudal theocracy the Nazis admired.<br\/> In Italy, Spain and other countries, similar tactics were used to prevent social revolution. Fascism had to call itself 'socialism' as capitalism was not an ideology which the ruling class could market effectively in the 1930s, given the fact that people were going hungry all over Europe and America. Everyone wanted some form of socialism, so the bosses came up with a form of socialism that would strengthen capitalism.<br\/> The tactics of the 'colour revolutions' follow a similar pattern, except nowadays the international situation has changed. In the absence of scientific socialist ideology, it is much easier to manipulate the public into believing that a 'spontaneous' and 'popular' uprising is taking place. This is because the 'colour revolutions', like their fascist forefathers in the 1930s, use left wing rhetoric in order to mobilize na\u00efve and misinformed youth to overthrow governments which the Western corporate elite considers to be an obstacle to their expansionist plans. Many of the governments targeted by imperialism have been loyal collaborators with the imperialists in the past. Ben Ali of Tunisia and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt are examples. Yet, imperialism often overthrows its puppets when they have outgrown their use or have disagreements with their masters. For example, Mubarak opposed the 2003 war on Iraq and refused to send troops to occupy that country. So, Mubarak was out and the fascist Muslim Brotherhood was in. That is how it works and the sooner genuine peace activists, anti-imperialists, communists and progressive learn the modalities of imperialist dialectics, the less chance these strategies have of enslaving humanity in a global corporate dystopia.<br\/> The comprador bourgeoisie in Brazil who enriched themselves by serving Wall Street interests during the military dictatorship and the neo-liberal regime of Cardoso, are using social engineering technologies to mobilize the people against 'corruption'. Here again, the aim is divert frustration with capitalism into frustration with politicians. This lets the corporate executives, bankers, plutocrats and financiers off the hook and puts all the blame on elected officials who are controlled by the captains of finance capitalism.<br\/> The point of the Brazil protests is to push for reforms that would deprive the Braziliancongress of executive powers. The protestors are therefore focusing their anger on the congress and, in particular, the left-wing of the Workers Party. Bourgeois ideology has always tried to associate socialist ideology with 'corruption'. Read any 'policy paper' by respectable Western economists on the post-Soviet Space and you will find that the more socialist the policy of the government the more that government is described as 'corrupt'. For capitalists, serving the public interest over the market is the essence of corruption. But there is a further twist to the Brazil protests. Here, it is precisely left-sounding causes, that is to say, cause of public interest that are advocated, such as schools, hospitals, health care, etc. But these are just empty slogans chanted by clueless, apolitical youth; they are a fa\u00e7ade to mask the true fascist intentions of the organizers.<br\/> In a revealing article from the 'Beyond Brics' blog in the Financial Times, the newspaper of the Anglo-Saxon elite, there is a 'wish list'. The article calls for president Rousseff to come up with a long term vision for the economy based on 'orthodox economics'; in other words, the Washington Consensus. People with international experience in business, especially in the private sector, should be included in her cabinet, says FT. The cabinet should be reduced from 40 to 15 and court cases should be speeded up.<br\/> Perhaps the Financial Times has people like Soros agent Aminio Fraga Neto in mind when it refers to people with experience in the private sector. The article concludes that none of these demands will be met because the Brazilian regime is simply too corrupt and incompetent. The wish list published by the Financial Times corresponds to the strategy of the global financial elite, which is to weaken the institutions of the nation state, so that multinational corporations do not need to worry about the rule of law when they want to rob and pillage the country's resources in accordance with the exigencies of 'orthodox economics'.<br\/> This is the plan of the rootless cosmopolitans, the heartless, and ruthless comprador bourgeoisie represented by the right wing opposition parties, who unlike current finance minister Guido Mantega, will not criticize US and EU fiscal policies and demand more influence over the IMF, while imposing capital controls and protective tariffs on US imports, who, unlike the current foreign minister, will not make statements opposing intervention[35] by Western powers against Syria, while demanding that Brazil be included in the UN Security Council.<br\/> The regime Washington wants to see installed will behave like the model countries of Latin America; countries like Colombia where union organisers, teachers and intellectuals who dare open their mouths against the government are shot dead. You won't see too many Avaaz activists in Bogota as long as that US colony is compliant with 'orthodox economics' and is fulfilling its annual quota of paramilitary murders in the service of 'good governance'.<br\/> The conflict playing itself out now in Brazil is between the progressive national bourgeoisie who want to see Brazil thrive, while maintaining their class interests and domination of the working class and the comprador bourgeoisie, who are using the petite-bourgeoisie to destroy Brazil as a functioning nation state, smash the BRICS multi-polar world order initiative, thereby fulfilling what President Obama promised to do before he was elected when he proclaimed, 'we have to reclaim Latin America'.

xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Nowhere is this more evident than when Bank of America recently declared that it would charge a monthly fee for the use of debit cards. When customers heard of this move, they were immediately upset. They anger was stirred even further when Bank of America CEO <person><nameText>Brian Moynihan <\/nameText><\/person>said, \u201cWe have a right to make a profit,\u201d at a Washington get-together, where he tried to explain why they were making this move.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\"> Tweeters and Facebook-users quickly ignited a fiery protest, which focused around comments such as, \u201cWe have a right to bank elsewhere.\u201d Emboldened by the comments of others, the online demonstration grew quickly to encompass many different blogs, media sites and even online signature protests.<\/p><p> It didn\u2019t take long before the digital torches opened the eyes of Moynihan and other Bank of America execs, who decided that a quick exit from their strategy was the only logical course of action. Bank of America withdrew plans for monthly charges for debit card users.<\/p><p> But enraged Bank of America customers had already taken their ire a step further. Propelled by a Facebook event page protest, more than 84,000 people signed up to join the mass exodus from the corporate banking world by moving their money out of banks and into credit unions. Saturday, Nov. 5, was promoted by protestors as \u201cBank Transfer Day.\u201d<\/p><p> The Credit Union National Association estimated in the week following the Sept. 29 debit card fee announcement by Bank of America, more than 650,000 Americans have joined credit unions.<\/p><p> The Bank of America debit card charge debacle is a perfect example of the power the Internet gives to the average person. The Internet and social media intensify public reaction. They give people more power than they have ever had before.<\/p><p> People don\u2019t actually have to boycott a product or service.They can simply talk about doing so, and if their complaints gain enough traction on the Internet, they will get the wanted reaction. Combined voices intensify grievances, and no company wants to stand against such speedy, persuasive and energetic protests.<\/p><p> Although Facebook and Twitter are currently the two most popular social media outlets, you don\u2019t have to have a Facebook or Twitter account to make your voice heard. Blogs are also a great place to voice your opinion. And you don\u2019t have to have your own blog either. You can post your comments on the blogs of others.<\/p><p> Last year, I made some accurate but disparaging remarks about one of the major telephone companies on my blog. Others posted similar comments on my blog in response. Within several days, a company representative came on the blog to say the company wanted to rectify the situation. The representative also sent me a personal email with a follow-up.<\/p><p> You can post your message or complaint on my blog at <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.sandybergerblog.com\">www.sandybergerblog.com<\/url> or any blog and get results. You don\u2019t even have to be totally on topic.<\/p><p> For instance, if you want to complain about a company that I haven\u2019t written about, you can add your comment to any blog post that I have written. I read every comment. So if you suggest that I write about a subject or company and it fits my subject matter, I\u2019ll be happy to write a new blog post on that topic where you and others can comment.<\/p><p> You might ask how I can be sure that the company you are trying to reach will see your comments. Well, that\u2019s easy. You see, every major company today uses clipping services that scour the Web and alert them when their company name is mentioned.<\/p><p> Many have crews of individuals who do nothing but sort through those comments and respond to them. Although the services that these companies use are generally pretty sophisticated, you can get a feel for how they work by trying a free service called Google Alerts at <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/alerts\">www.google.com\/alerts<\/url>.

They recommend that Apple creates an \"essential mode\" which would limit the iPhone to making calls, sending and receiving texts, and taking photos.Apple founder Steve Jobs gave a famous commencement speech[1] at Stanford University in 2005 where he reminded students their \"time is limited.\" <\/p><p>Over a decade later, a group of Stanford students are doing something to take their time back \u2014 by protesting Apple for making addictive devices. A new group called Stanford Students Against Addictive Devices held a protest at an Apple store in the heart of Silicon Valley over the weekend, according to the Stanford Daily[2] and Palo Alto Online[3]. It turns out the group is being led by Stanford computer science majors \u2014 people who are learning the exact skills that are needed to build the systems that many blame for device addiction. The Stanford students explained why they were protesting Apple specifically in a pamphlet[4] on their website[5]. \"iPhones are our gateway to addictive services (read: Facebook and company), so Apple is uniquely capable of helping us curb our dependence,\" they explained[6]. \"Even though Apple's business model does not rely on device addiction, they fail to take common sense steps to address the issue.\" Three students leading the group,Sanjay Kannaan, Evan Sabri Eyuboglu, and Cameron Ramos, are senior computer science majors, according to the Stanford Daily[7]. They're joined by Divya Gupta, a physician at Stanford Hospital. The group also outlines a way for Apple to \"take phone addiction seriously.\" They recommend Apple build new features into the iPhone including one that tracks phone usage, more fine-grained control over notifications, and proposes an \"essential mode\" that only does calls, texts, and photos. In the meantime, the students recommend users turn their notifications off and try using their phone in a grey mode \"to minimize dopamine hits.\" It's unclear how many people attended Saturday's protest. Palo Alto Online said a \"steady stream of friends and supporters\" joined them through the afternoon. The Facebook invite for the event said nine people attended and 28 were interested.NOW WATCH: The NFL is using this football helmet that morphs on impact to reduce head injuries[8]See Also: A Chinese smartphone company no one has ever heard of is making a huge impact in 2018, and it's innovating more than Apple or Samsung[9]An analyst estimated how long Apple customers hold onto their devices \u2014 and the findings might surprise you[10]Last year's iPhones are destroying Samsung's new Galaxy flagship smartphone in benchmark tests[11] SEE ALSO:I have 2 simple rules for taking a month-long break from social media and being 'extremely online'[12] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/the-full-text-of-steve-jobs-stanford-commencement-speech-2011-10?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/the-full-text-of-steve-jobs-stanford-commencement-speech-2011-10?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner<\/url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https:\/\/www.stanforddaily.com\/2018\/03\/05\/student-group-protests-apple-over-addictive-devices\/\">https:\/\/www.stanforddaily.com\/2018\/03\/05\/student-group-protests-apple-over-addictive-devices\/<\/url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https:\/\/www.paloaltoonline.com\/news\/2018\/03\/04\/stanford-students-call-on-public-to-unplug-at-apple-store\">https:\/\/www.paloaltoonline.com\/news\/2018\/03\/04\/stanford-students-call-on-public-to-unplug-at-apple-store<\/url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https:\/\/captive.ml\/pamphlet.pdf\">https:\/\/captive.ml\/pamphlet.pdf<\/url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https:\/\/captive.ml\">https:\/\/captive.ml<\/url>\/ [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https:\/\/captive.ml\/pamphlet.pdf\">https:\/\/captive.ml\/pamphlet.pdf<\/url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https:\/\/www.stanforddaily.com\/2018\/03\/05\/student-group-protests-apple-over-addictive-devices\/\">https:\/\/www.stanforddaily.com\/2018\/03\/05\/student-group-protests-apple-over-addictive-devices\/<\/url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/zero1-morphing-football-helmet-nfl-uses-super-bowl-ncaa-2018-2?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/zero1-morphing-football-helmet-nfl-uses-super-bowl-ncaa-2018-2?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner<\/url> [ 9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/vivo-innovating-more-than-apple-or-samsung-2018-2?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/vivo-innovating-more-than-apple-or-samsung-2018-2?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner<\/url> [ 10]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/apple-iphone-ipad-watch-mac-life-estimate-asymco-horace-dediu-2018-3?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/apple-iphone-ipad-watch-mac-life-estimate-asymco-horace-dediu-2018-3?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner<\/url> [ 11]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/last-years-iphone-destroying-samsung-galaxy-s9-in-benchmarks-2018-3?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/last-years-iphone-destroying-samsung-galaxy-s9-in-benchmarks-2018-3?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner<\/url> [ 12]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/i-take-social-media-break-once-a-year-feel-much-better-2018-2?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/i-take-social-media-break-once-a-year-feel-much-better-2018-2?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner<\/url><\/p><p\/><\/body>","728":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">But why does everyone hate Monsanto &amp; does it really matter?<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">A sangoma and a finely manicured suburban matriarch.

This meant the farmers could spray the crops, killing the surrounding weeds and pests without doing any harm to the crops themselves. However, after a number of years have passed, many weeds and pests have themselves become resistant to the spray, and herbicide-use increased (both in amount and strength) by 11% between 1996 and 2011. Which translates to - lots more pesticide residue in our foods\".<\/p><p>The African Centre for Biosafety has produced a document that claims that Africa is being bullied into producing defective Bt Maize.<\/p><p>It lists the following as one of its key findings;<\/p><p>\"Monsanto's Bt maize, MON810, has failed hopelessly in South Africa as a result of massive insect resistance, after only 15 years of its introduction into commercial agriculture. In an effort to deal with the pest infestation, Monsanto has compensated South African farmers who experienced more than 10% damage on their genetically modified (GM) insect resistant crops - some farmers experienced as high as 50% insect infestation.\"<\/p><p>The full document can be accessed here.<\/p><p>The Centre describes genetic engineering as \"undoubtedly one of the most controversial technologies to emerge in the 20th Century; the advent of modern biotechnology has 'triggered major scientific, social and political controversies' since its introduction in the 1970's\".<\/p><p>Meanwhile, the debate rages on. Some argue that GMOs produce better yields while others dispute this. They say that while you pay more for GM seeds, there is reduced spraying of herbicides and pesticides and a better quality product is produced.<\/p><p>But at the heart of all the passion, the research, the for and against ... is there something else at play?<\/p><p>There are few issues that create as much heated passion than Monsanto and GMO.

I'm not opposed to using GMOs as a metaphor to discuss our technological hubris (or prowess) - I just want us to be explicit about it. We should notice when the metaphor begins to diverge from the ground truth. The facts on the ground, in turn, can help us adjust our thinking on the larger issue.<\/p><p>\"We need metaphors - they're how we come to understand the world.

However, for the students, one of the key achievements was the hashtag Hokkolorob, which went viral on social networking sites ever since it was launched last September. It further picked up pace this week after the CM's announcement on the VCs resignation, which was their main demand, and the withdrawal of the indefinite hunger strike by a few students.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Avishek De Biswas, a theatre actor and ex-student of the university, can be dubbed as the accidental author of the hashtag. He was initially trying to support his friend, the woman student of JU who was molested and harassed on campus in August last year. The controversy resulted in the standoff between students and university authorities and culminated in an indefinite hunger strike by a group of students since early this year and an embarrassment for the university authorities when a large section of them boycotted the formal convocation ceremony.<\/p><p>Spreading the Web<\/p><p>\"Even though I have finished my Masters in comparative literature from the university in 2013, I'm in touch with many of my juniors and professors. In fact, the girl who faced harassment by some seniors called me soon after the incident for help. I was among those who tried to help her get an FIR registered,\" says De Biswas. \"The protests built up around the lack of support for the student and no action against the guilty by the university authorities and later the beating up of students by the police during a peaceful demonstration,\" he adds. After the initial apathy shown by the college authorities, he casually said \"Hokkolorob\" - let there be noise - to a group of friends, borrowing the phrase from the name of a Bengali music album by Shayan Chowdhury (Arnob) released in 2006.<\/p><p>Scoring a First<\/p><p>\"The phrase caught the imagination of all of us on campus immediately. Initially, it was being used as a hashtag on Facebook by many students. But within a couple of days, after the police lathicharge, students from many other campuses around the world started following the developments and using the hashtag on Twitter and Facebook,\" says Anisha Mandal, an undergrad of JU in the comparative literature department. She adds that the way it went viral was beyond expectations and a first for a student movement in India.<\/p><p>Hokkolorob, a community page on Facebook, currently has 56,713 likes, with hundreds of posts added in the past week.According to hashtag tracking tool Keyhole, Hokkolorob had a reach of 342,130 users this week. Among the prominent people using the hashtag on various social networking sites are Bengali actor Swastika Mukherjee and Union minister of state for urban development Babul Supriyo.<\/p><p>Ex-students of the JU too responded to Hokkolorob. \"The first time when I heard about this a few months back, I searched for the hashtag on Facebook to understand what was going on. Thereafter I used to monitor it to stay updated,\" says Amitavha Mukherjee, a New Jersey-based ex-student in mechanical engineering from the class of 1998 and now vice-president, Citigroup Inc. Mukherjee is part of the executive committee of the local alumni chapter, Jadavpur University East Coast Alumni Association ( JUECA). \"The incidents in the campus did naturally draw my attention, and thereafter I connected with a few folks who are in the campus. I also participated in a few conference calls and arranged some local folk in a Skype video-conference. And yes, I did use the hashtag in Facebook, myself,\" he adds.<\/p><p>The Global Connect<\/p><p>Like him, New York-based entrepreneur Shib Shankar Dasgupta updated himself about the movement through the hashtag posts on Facebook and Twitter. \"We organised a meeting of JU alumni based in the US East Coast at NYC's Central Park in support of the students. The hashtag helped us to stay updated and to share our thoughts. We are very happy that the demand for the VC's resignation has been met,\" Dasgupta told ET Magazine.<\/p><p>Aritra Chakraborti, a PhD student of the English department, who is currently a visiting researcher at King's College, London, too feels that the hashtag Hokkolorob helped the students take the spirit of their protest to the academic community around the world. \"When the protest started, I was in Belgium. The use of the hashtag helped me share the developments with my colleagues across universities in Europe. Even though I was not physically present on campus, I felt myself a part of what was happening at JU and could offer my support through posts on social media. While this has happened in other countries such as Hong Kong and Egypt during mass student movements, in India it was probably the first time,\" he said.<\/p><p>For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com<\/p><\/body>","72":"<body><h>FULL TEXT<\/h><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Campaigners have threatened to extend direct action protests after once again forcing Vodafone stores to shut.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Activists have gathered under the banner of UK Uncut to demonstrate against Vodafone, claiming it has been let off a tax bill - an allegation strongly denied by both the company and HM Revenue and Customs.<\/p><p>After another day of protests today, campaigners said they planned to target other high street stores and banks.<\/p><p>The Vodafone store in Broadmead in Bristol was among those closed as protesters gathered.

The events are supported by Team Internet, a grassroots network of nearly half a million volunteer activists spearheaded by Demand Progress, Fight for the Future, and Free Press Action Fund, three of the groups behind the massive July 12 Net Neutrality day of action that drove millions of comments, emails, and phone calls to the FCC and Congress.<\/p><p>Over recent months the groups behind the protests have organized thousands of constituents to attend more than 600 town halls and meetings with lawmakers to demand their support for Net Neutrality. A phone call campaign through BattleForTheNet.com has generated nearly 250,000 phone calls to legislators offices.<\/p><p>At the protests participants will be encouraged to take a group photo and tweet it at their local members of Congress. Where possible, protesters will march to a nearby lawmaker's office and deliver petition signatures.<\/p><p>Protests are currently planned in Phoenix, Denver, San Francisco, New York City, Indianapolis, Boston, and several other cities across the country. They're being organized by volunteers in a grassroots manner using email, texting, and social media. Local internet users can volunteer to host a protest, and then connect with other volunteers in their area and encourage them to attend. There will be a special protest event in Washington, DC, details are TBA.<\/p><p>\"This is the free speech fight of our generation and internet users are pissed off and paying attention\" said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, \"Ajit Pai may be owned by Verizon, but he has to answer to Congress, and lawmakers have to answer to us, their constituents. The corrupt bureaucrats trying to kill Net Neutrality are hoping to avoid public backlash by burying the news over the Holiday weekend. We're taking our protest from the internet to the streets to make sure that doesn't happen,\" she added.<\/p><p>\"FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has been too busy meeting with industry lobbyists and greedy Verizon executives to hear the outcry from millions of people who are joining together to reject his plan to kill off Net Neutrality,\" said Free Press Action Fund Field Director Mary Alice Crim. \"People know that the open internet is essential for accessing everything from elder care to mental health services and they're willing to fight for it. That's why Team Internet members have met face-to-face with hundreds of members of Congress and their staff, organized others in their communities, and spoken out on behalf of Net Neutrality.

The American combat outpost in Kamdesh District, just a few miles from the Pakistan border, was badly situated -- sitting in a valley surrounded on all sides by steep mountains. Insurgents had snuck into the high ridge lines and were firing down on the Americans.<\/p><p>An (INAUDIBLE) Afghan security posts was first to be hit. Then, the American portion of the base was pounded by enemy mortars, rockets and machine guns. Other militants fired from their positions at a mosque in a nearby village.<\/p><p>JOHN NAGL, CENTER FOR NEW AMERICAN SECURITY: There were apparently coordinated assaults by upwards of 100 enemy fighters who had planned the attack very thoroughly, chose their time, chose to fight at a time when there was heavy cloud cover so that air power wouldn't be as effective.<\/p><p>STARR: The fight raged for some 12 hours before the attack was finally repelled. Eight U.S. troops were killed, 25 wounded.<\/p><p>There are a string of isolated U.S. outposts like the one that got attacked this weekend up and down the border with Pakistan. Last year, we visited one where just a few dozen troops were trying to defend their position. The job at these outposts -- keep militants from crossing over from Pakistan. But with so few U.S. troops, it's a tough job and U.S. forces increasingly are coming under attack.<\/p><p>General Stanley McChrystal, the top commander, has ordered many of the outposts closed so the troops can be sent to more highly populated areas to protect Afghans.<\/p><p>NAGL: The sort of attack that -- that helps us understand that the Taliban is growing stronger, that we don't have enough forces on the ground right now in Afghanistan.<\/p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)<\/p><p>STARR: And, Wolf, U.S. military officials do confirm that this outpost where so many were killed was scheduled to be shut down. The troops were just waiting for word on when that would happen -- Wolf.<\/p><p>BLITZER: How sad is that?<\/p><p>All right, Barbara, thank you.<\/p><p>The stakes in Afghanistan certainly enormous, as is the pressure <person><nameText>President Obama <\/nameText><\/person>is facing right now. Defense Secretary Robert Gates says -- and he says very bluntly -- it doesn't get much more serious than this.<\/p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>ROBERT GATES, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: Afghanistan has been on a different and worrisome trajectory, with violence levels up some 60 percent from last year. I believe the decisions that the president will make for the next stage of the Afghanistan campaign will be among the most important of his presidency. Speaking for the Department of Defense, once the commander-in-chief makes his decisions, we will salute and execute those decisions faithfully and to the best of our ability.<\/p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)<\/p><p>BLITZER: Secretary Gates also appeared to push back against loud calls for a rapid troop increase, including from the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, General Stanley McChrystal. Gates said -- and I'm quoting now -- \"It's important to take our time and get this right.\"<\/p><p>This story just coming into THE SITUATION ROOM.<\/p><p>Ohio's governor is putting two pending executions on hold in the wake of a botched lethal injection that went on for two hours before being called off.<\/p><p>Let's bring back Brian Todd.<\/p><p>He's got the latest developments for us -- Brian, explain what's going on.<\/p><p>BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Right, Wolf. Just last hour, we reported that a federal appeals court had halted the execution of one of these inmates, Lawrence Reynolds, because of that botched execution last month.<\/p><p>Well, just since that report, Ohio's governor, Ted Strickland, has stepped in and granted temporary reprieves to Lawrence Reynolds and another inmate named Darryl Durr, who were both scheduled to be executed this fall. Reynolds scheduled to be executed later this week; Durr scheduled to be put to death in November.<\/p><p>But Ohio's governor stepping in now, saying these two will get reprieves until next spring -- the spring of 2010, while they figure out a backup to the lethal injection protocol, some way to handle it better than the way they did on September 15th. That, of course, was the execution -- the slated execution of Romell Broom, when they tried to inject him 18 times. They couldn't find a vein. Finally, they brought him out of the preparation chamber. His execution still on hold.<\/p><p>So Ohio's governor is essentially saying until we get this right, that execution is on hold. And these other two are on hold until next spring.<\/p><p>BLITZER: Are there other execate -- executions also being delayed?<\/p><p>TODD: Very interesting in his statement, he in -- the governor indicated that there are three others that are scheduled to be executed -- December, January and February. He is not putting those executions off for now. He is saying he's confident that they will find a solution to this problem by that time. But he says if they do not find a solution, he may give them reprieves, as well.<\/p><p>But those three -- for December, January, February -- right now are scheduled to go off as planned. But, again, they're trying to figure out solutions to these botched this -- this botched execution method. And whether they do it by December 1st, that's an open question. BLITZER: Brian, thank you.<\/p><p>Let's bring in our senior legal analyst, Jeff Toobin -- Jeff, how significant is all of this?<\/p><p>JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: Well, you know, Wolf, the history of bocked -- botched executions in the United States is almost as long as the history of executions. It turns out the state has a hard time doing executions right all the time.<\/p><p>In 1946, the famous case of Willy Francis in Louisiana -- his execution was botched. His case went all the way to the Supreme Court and ultimately he was allowed to be executed. Chances are that's what happened. The Supreme -- that's what will happen.<\/p><p>The Supreme Court has upheld lethal injections. It's upheld the death penalty. And I expect eventually, these executions will be allowed to take place.<\/p><p>BLITZER: All right, Jeff, don't go away, because I want to talk about the new Supreme Court session -- today being the first Monday in October.<\/p><p>Stand by.<\/p><p>We'll get back to you in a moment.<\/p><p>Let's bring back Jack Cafferty, though, right now.<\/p><p>He has The Cafferty File -- Jack.<\/p><p>CAFFERTY: They say they tried 18 times to find this guy's vein and couldn't find it?<\/p><p>BLITZER: Yes, they couldn't find it. I know.<\/p><p>CAFFERTY: They've got to keep trying. I mean he's not going anywhere. Just stay with it.<\/p><p>BLITZER: Well, they spent two hours trying to do it.<\/p><p>CAFFERTY: Well, you know, put the crew on overtime and stay -- stay after it.<\/p><p><person><nameText>President Obama <\/nameText><\/person>has only been in office a little more than eight months now, but many are wondering, including \"Saturday Night Live,\" if his political capital might already be spent. The president came into office, had several top priorities -- health care reform, climate change legislation.<\/p><p>Health care, as you're painfully aware, has taken up most of the summer and -- and a good part of the fall. It's not clear what the final outcome is going to be there. Democrats say they're close to bringing the legislation to the floor in both houses of Congress for debate. They say they're confident some kind of a bill will pass this year. And they say they see more momentum now than they did under President Clinton 15 years ago, which, when you think about it, is irrelevant, because if health care reform doesn't pass, does it really matter how much momentum it had?<\/p><p>As for climate change, forget about that. That isn't going to happen, either. The president's top energy adviser says there's no way Congress will be able to pass a bill this year. That means the U.S. will have nothing to show when talks on a global climate treaty begin in Copenhagen in December.<\/p><p>I'm not finished yet.<\/p><p>In the wake of the financial meltdown last year, <person><nameText>President Obama <\/nameText><\/person>and Democratic leaders talked about the need to impose new financial regulations on Wall Street. But so far, that's all that is -- just talk. Nothing's been done. Nothing will be, at least not this year.<\/p><p>Anyway, here's the question -- what major new laws will Congress have passed by the time it adjourns for the year in early December?<\/p><p>Go to CNN.com\/caffertyfile and post a comment on my blog.<\/p><p>I guess the other thing to remember is once they break for the holidays, Wolf, and then they come back after the first of the year, all eyes are on the mid-term elections next November and nobody is going to want to do anything that would risk them holding onto these tidy little jobs they all have.<\/p><p>BLITZER: You mean, the -- these are not profiles in courage, Jack, is that what you're suggesting?<\/p><p>CAFFERTY: They're profiles in something else.<\/p><p>BLITZER: All right. Jack.<\/p><p>Thanks very much.<\/p><p>A desert monument at the center of what could be a monumental Supreme Court case -- it's church versus state.<\/p><p>Which side will the justices choose?<\/p><p>Also, critics of <person><nameText>David Letterman <\/nameText><\/person>now saying his affairs with female employees amount to sexual harassment. We're watching the fallout of the blackmail sex scandal swirling around the late night comedian.<\/p><p>And murder on the job -- the most extreme form of workplace violence. But bullying, harassment, even physical altercations -- they're all on the rise.<\/p><p>So what's going on?<\/p><p>BLITZER: The U.S. Supreme Court officially begins its new term today, with the new justice, Sonia Sotomayor, on the bench. The question before the court today -- how long should a suspect's request for a lawyer be considered valid?<\/p><p>In the days ahead, the Justices will hear arguments for and against an eight foot cross put up in the middle of the California desert.<\/p><p>CNN's Kate Bolduan went to see the cross for herself and to find out what the controversy is all about.<\/p><p>KATE BOLDUAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, behind these plywood boards is what stands at the center of a fight that's made its way all the way to the high court -- all against this desert backdrop miles from civilization.<\/p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)<\/p><p>BOLDUAN: (voice-over): You could very easily drive right by or mistake it for a forgotten billboard in the middle of 1.6 million acres of desert. But inside is a cross, boarded up by order of a federal judge -- a cross creating a huge Constitutional controversy.<\/p><p>(on camera): How many miles do you guys travel from your home to come take care of the memorial?<\/p><p>HENRY SANDOZ: Well, we don't really -- we don't really take care of it now because of the box. But we're 160 miles away from it now.<\/p><p>BOLDUAN: (voice-over): Henry and Wanda Sandoz have been the unofficial caretakers of what for decades has been known as the Mojave Memorial Cross, first erected in 1934 by their friend, a World War I veteran, to honor fallen soldiers.<\/p><p>WANDA SANDOZ: We just love our veterans and we feel that they should be honored.<\/p><p>H. SANDOZ: Yes.<\/p><p>W. SANDOZ: And -- and this is right here in this little piece of our world. That's how we did it.<\/p><p>BOLDUAN: But it also sits in the Mojave National Preserve, government land. And some now argue that cross is violating the Constitutional guarantee of separation of church and state.<\/p><p>PETER ELIASBERG, ACLU, SOUTHERN COORDINATOR: Well, what Mr. Buono wants is neutrality and a complete remedy here.<\/p><p>BOLDUAN: Peter Eliasberg is ACLU attorney for Frank Buono, a former Ranger who worked in the preserve, the man who filed the original lawsuit. While Buono is Catholic and a veteran, he says the Mojave Cross should go.<\/p><p>ELIASBERG: For the government to say we're going to impose on each and every one of you veterans this religious symbol, even though for many of you, it is not your religious symbol, that is not an appropriate expression of religion in public life. BOLDUAN: Jewish and Muslim Vietnamese groups support Buono. But attorneys for the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Sandozes say the cross is a historical memorial, not a religious symbol, warning the outcome of this case could have far-reaching implications.<\/p><p>HIRAM SASSER, LIBERTY LEGAL INSTITUTE: And this is the first one that's going up to the Supreme Court and they want to make sure that this one prevails so that all the veterans memorials with religious imagery across country can be protected.<\/p><p>BOLDUAN: (on camera): Why not just take this memorial -- same cross, same memorial -- and just move it to a less controversial location?<\/p><p>H. SANDOZ: It -- it was put here by the veterans, for the veterans of all wars. And that's where it should stay.<\/p><p>BOLDUAN: (voice-over): In recent years, the Supreme Court has taken a case by case approach on this issue, allowing the Ten Commandments to remain on public property in a Texas case; the same day ruling a display of the Ten Commandments in a Kentucky courthouse unconstitutional.<\/p><p>With its caretakers anxiously standing watch, it's now up to the high court to decide the fate of this cross.<\/p><p>W. SANDOZ: I hope it won't be too long before we'll be able to look at the cross again instead of this stupid box.<\/p><p>H. SANDOZ: Really. And we'll repaint it.<\/p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)<\/p><p>BOLDUAN: No matter the outcome, this case could be a major test of if and where the government will draw the line when it comes to any private expression on public land -- Wolf.<\/p><p>BLITZER: All right, Kate.<\/p><p>Thank you.<\/p><p>Kate Bolduan reporting for us.<\/p><p>Let's get some analysis on this and some other important cases.<\/p><p>We're joined once again by our senior legal analyst, Jeff Toobin -- Jeff, I sense a 5-4 decision coming up on this case, but I -- I have no idea who's going to prevail.<\/p><p>TOOBIN: It really is a hard case because the Justices just struggle with these church-state issues. The test seems to be, at the moment, is, is the display, is the cross, is the Ten Commandments perceived by a reasonable person as an endorsement of religion?<\/p><p>A couple of years ago, they said the -- the Ten Commandments in the park in Austin, Texas not an endorsement. In the halls of a courthouse, that was an endorsement.<\/p><p>My sense is, 5-4, the court will say this is not an endorsement of religion, it's an historical marker, it doesn't have great religious significance. I think the Justices will leave it up.<\/p><p>BLITZER: Justice Kennedy being the swing vote in this one?<\/p><p>TOOBIN: He is just about the most important and most powerful justice in our lifetime, because the court is so polarized -- four liberals, four conservatives. Justice Kennedy holds the outcome in his hands in so many cases.<\/p><p>BLITZER: There's another case involving the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms. A lot of conservatives are nervous watching this case. Explain its significance.<\/p><p>TOOBIN: Well, two years ago, the Justices said that the Second Amendment, which speaks of the right to keep and bear arms, gives individuals a right to keep and bear arms against federal regulations of guns.<\/p><p>But the case at issue here is what about states and localities?<\/p><p>Does the Second Amendment give individuals a right against state and federal -- state and local gun controls?<\/p><p>And it's actually more important, because most gun control laws are actually state and local laws, not federal laws.<\/p><p>BLITZER: So -- but they're taking a look at this right now.<\/p><p>How does it shape up in terms of the makeup of the court once again?<\/p><p>TOOBIN: Again, I'd check in with Justice Kennedy, because he is really the swing vote on these gun cases. He was the swing vote in the famous \"Heller\" case, which said that the D.C. Gun control law was unconstitutional. Again, my sense is, given the fact that they ruled that this was a fundamental right versus the federal government, I think they'll probably rule that way versus state government as well.<\/p><p>BLITZER: There's another...<\/p><p>TOOBIN: So they'll strike down the law.<\/p><p>BLITZER: There's another case involving children convicted of crimes, short -- less than homicide, not homicide -- how long they can serve in jail if they're 13, 14, 15 years old.<\/p><p>Tell us about this case.<\/p><p>TOOBIN: Well, again, Justice Kennedy, five years ago, wrote an opinion which said that the state could no longer execute juvenile offenders. If you committed your crime before the age of 18, the most you could get is life in prison without parole. But the question in this case is, if a juvenile -- a child commits a crime short of murder -- in this case, a rape and a robbery -- can that person, that child, get life in prison without parole?<\/p><p>Again, a very hard case, because Justice Kennedy seems inclined to judge juveniles by a different standard, but he's also a tough on crime justice. He also thinks that states should be allowed to create their own punishments. That's the tension in this case.<\/p><p>BLITZER: And in this particular case, there is someone serving a life without parole sentence right now, who was 13 when convicted of rape.<\/p><p>And that's the basis for this case, is that right?<\/p><p>TOOBIN: That's right. And there are, in fact, several other people in other states -- teenagers who were convicted of crimes short of murm -- short of murder -- who are serving life without parole sentences. So it doesn't just affect the Florida person, it affects people in several other states, as well.<\/p><p>BLITZER: This Supreme Court is about as equally divided as possible. And basically what -- what I hear you saying is Justice Sotomayor is not going to make, at least in the short-term, a huge amount of difference given her perspective and the person she replaced.<\/p><p>TOOBIN: Probably not. Justice Souter was a moderate liberal. Justice Sotomayor gives every sign of being a moderate liberal. But you know, as Justice Byron White liked to say, when you change one justice, you don't change one justice, you change the whole court. The change may be subtle at first, but if you start to see Obama appointees -- even if they are replacing other liberals -- starting to assert themselves on the court, that could have an impact even if the balance of power doesn't shift right away.<\/p><p>BLITZER: Jeff is not only our single legal analyst, he's the author of the great book, \"The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court,\" which was a huge, huge best-seller. It's out in paperback right now and I highly, highly recommend it.<\/p><p>Jeff, thanks for coming in.<\/p><p>TOOBIN: Thanks, Wolf.<\/p><p>BLITZER: The end of a major American magazine -- it's folding after almost 70 years in public -- in publication.<\/p><p>Stand by.<\/p><p>And America has its first black president -- is the Roman Catholic Church ready for a black pope?<\/p><p>One leader says the time has come.<\/p><p>BLITZER: Betty Nguyen is monitoring some other important stories incoming into THE SITUATION ROOM right now -- Betty, what's going on?<\/p><p>BETTY NGUYEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Wolf.<\/p><p>Yes, well, five employees of the UN's World Food Program in Islamabad are dead after a suicide bomber struck their office. The bomber, seen here in this video that we're about to put up there -- entering the building. He was also killed in that blast. Now, the attack occurred near the residence of Pakistan's president. At least one other United Nations office is located in that same area.<\/p><p>And there is new video of North Korea's reclusive leader, Kim Jong Il. He looked in pretty good health as he went to the airport to greet the visiting Chinese premier. The red carpet welcome is seen as a sign of the importance which Pyongyang places on its relations with Beijing. Both countries hailed their close ties. But bringing North Korea back to Chinese-hosted nuclear talks was said to be the visit's main mission.<\/p><p>And it is the magazine foodies savored. And the rest of us, well, just enjoyed looking at it at the doctor's office. But copies of \"Gourmet\" magazine will soon be hard to find. Conde Nast says a devastating ad slump has forced it had to discontinue the title. \"Gourmet\" magazine first hit the newsstands back in 1940. Now, the publisher is also closing \"Modern Bride,\" \"Elegant Bride\" and \"Cooking.\" So we're going to see all those magazines go by the wayside -- Wolf.<\/p><p>And listen to this -- a prominent African-American Cardinal says there is no reason why the next pope cannot be black, especially after <person><nameText>President Obama's <\/nameText><\/person>election.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is not about urban crime, it's not about university crime, it's not about domestic crime, but an issue of workplace violence.<\/p><p>COSTELLO: And it happens in tiny towns, too, like Caribou, Maine.<\/p><p>JOHNA LOVELY, DAUGHTER MURDERED BY CO-WORKER: And it's, well, what happened? And they said she was beaten to death.<\/p><p>COSTELLO: Johna Lovely lost her youngest daughter January 2, 2005. Erin, just 20 years old, was killed by a co-worker while working the night shift at a Tim Hortons restaurant by a young man she mentioned to her sister just days earlier.<\/p><p>AMANDA SYLVIA, SISTER MURDERED BY CO-WORKER: She said he was kind of creepy is all she said, but she didn't seem overly concerned about it, so it didn't really raise that many suspicions with me either.<\/p><p>COSTELLO (on camera): When you found out it was someone she worked with, did it make it more difficult to deal with?<\/p><p>LOVELY: Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. It wasn't a random thing, you know? It was - it was her. He was - he wanted her.<\/p><p>COSTELLO (voice-over): Nationwide, 517 people were murdered at work last year, according to government stats, and while that number is down 52 percent since 1994, an American college survey found things like bullying, harassment, even physical altercations are up.<\/p><p>LARRY BARTON, PRESIDENT, THE AMERICAN COLLEGE: The call volume to human resource officers, to their EAP programs, counselors, is skyrocketing. We are absolutely in a period right now of among the highest periods of threats at work in certainly recent memory.<\/p><p>COSTELLO: Erin was first attacked by her co-worker, Christopher Shumway, in the store freezer. At one point, according to police record, she got out but was eventually overpowered. Like Yale student Annie Le, who police say was strangled by a co-worker, Erin ended up alone with her attacker.<\/p><p>COSTELLO (on camera): When you heard about what happened at Yale, what went through your mind?<\/p><p>LOVELY: I just cried and cried and cried and - and so it just kind of brought everything right back.<\/p><p>COSTELLO (voice-over): Shumway was convicted of murder and sentenced to 45 years in prison. Lovely and her older daughter have set up a fund in Erin's name. For the past five years, they've tried to convince companies to install panic buttons connected to police departments so employees in danger can get immediate help. They thought armed with Erin's story, it would be a cinch. They were wrong. SYLVIA: It was frustrating. You kind of want to look at the business owners and just scream at them and say why? Why? I don't understand why you wouldn't want to keep your employees safe.<\/p><p>COSTELLO: While she says most businesses did turn down the offer of free installation for new security systems, 18 did agree to install panic buttons.<\/p><p>ROB FRANK, STORE OWNER: I have no idea why more people don't want to do this. I really don't.<\/p><p>COSTELLO: People might think, oh, I live in a small town, nothing ever happens here, so why bother?<\/p><p>FRANK: Yes, well, they're wrong. I mean, crime is everywhere.<\/p><p>LOVELY: We bring stuff all the time.<\/p><p>COSTELLO: Erin's family says they won't give up.<\/p><p>LOVELY: I want people to remember her and to remember what happened to her. I want people to be safe at work because of her, and I want businesses to take notice.<\/p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)<\/p><p>COSTELLO (on camera): Tim Hortons, Erin Sperrey's employer at the time of her murder, stepped up after Sperrey's death. They say they beefed up security procedures at all of their stores in the United States and Canada. That includes mandatory camera and recording systems in some restaurants -- Wolf.<\/p><p>BLITZER: Carol, thank you.

CNN's Arwa Damon has a truly extraordinary view of a mountain that exploded and barreled down a hill.<\/p><p>BLITZER: In Indonesia, the search for survivors has now been called off. Last week's massive earthquake at Sumatra left hundreds dead. Officials now say nearly 100,000 homes were destroyed and tens of thousands more buildings were damaged.<\/p><p>Today, students whose schools are still standing went back to class for the first time since the disaster. CNN's Dan Rivers is there with their story.<\/p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)<\/p><p>DAN RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Charged with emotion and grief, this is the first morning assembly at the high school in Padang since the earthquake. For many, these past few days have been too much. Only half the 800 children are present. It's not yet known how many have died.<\/p><p>A teacher is overcome after learning at least one member of staff is among the dead.<\/p><p>GUSTINA, ENGLISH TEACHER: They feel very sad. They can't control their emotion, with the -- with this reality. Our school is broken.<\/p><p>RIVERS: But it's not just broken in spirit. The very fabric of the school has been smashed apart. The ceilings of most the classrooms have fallen in. Thankfully, lessons had finished when the walls collapsed onto the desks.<\/p><p>RIVERS (on camera): Many of the students have mixed feelings about being back at school. They're happy to see that their friends are OK, but many of them are worried there will be another earthquake.<\/p><p>RIVERS (voice-over): It's not surprising. Many students are living in homes that now lie in ruins. This house belongs to one student who just made it out.<\/p><p>HARIA FITRI, STUDENT: I jumped. After I ,jumped the ceiling collapsed.<\/p><p>RIVERS: So you only just made it out?<\/p><p>FITRI: Yes. I just made it out. I - I was very lucky.<\/p><p>RIVERS: And what's it like being back here at school?<\/p><p>FITRI: I feel worried about maybe I - I always think that maybe there will be another earthquake, so I - I'm worried.<\/p><p>HARRIS PUTRAREZE, STUDENT: When I see my school, very big destruction, I get a little sad, but I'm very happy to be back to my school.<\/p><p>RIVERS: It will be a long time before school is back to normal. Lessons are being held in a tent, and, all around, little reminders of the day the earth shook so violently - a day none of these students will forget for the rest of their lives.<\/p><p>Dan Rivers, CNN, Padang, Indonesia.<\/p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)<\/p><p>BLITZER: Aid is slowly reaching some of the more remote areas hit by the earthquake. CNN's Arwa Damon traveled with a group of volunteers and met a young woman who lost her whole family in this disaster. Here's her tragic story.<\/p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)<\/p><p>ARWA DAMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This was once the village of Malalak. Now it's a mass grave. Amid the spectators and onlookers, one young woman stands alone. She tells us how she was at her boarding school when the quake struck. She learned from the news her village was damaged, and no one had the heart to tell her, her family was dead.<\/p><p>Now the 18-year-old is left orphaned, alone, fighting the most intense of sorrows spelled out on her young face. Her father, mother and two younger brothers and sister all perished here. Her uncle who was helping direct the search saw her home swallowed by the earth.<\/p><p>\"When the landslide happened, it was like doomsday had come,\" he tells us. \"I just held my parents. If not, then I was scared I would be swept away.\"<\/p><p>(on camera): Right after the earthquake the side of the mountain here literally exploded and came barreling down, sweeping up everything in its path. In this very spot, right where I'm standing now, there used to be a mosque that had a volleyball court just in front, and at the time of the earthquake and landslide, there were nearly a dozen children that were playing outside.<\/p><p>(voice-over): More than 30 villagers young and old lost their lives in Malalak. We came out here with a small aid convoy. Already along the road we could see the devastation. A small local volunteer group like this one have rallied together to get much-needed food, water, medical supplies and tents to the outlying areas.<\/p><p>This one, an initiative by the Romeo Pasal Pongiello (ph), the regional director for Bank of Indonesia.<\/p><p>Although aid is much needed throughout the quake zone as families try to rebuild their homes, for some their losses cannot replaced.<\/p><p>\"My brothers and sisters use to always run towards me saying, hey, my sister is home,\" Septiani remembers. Still, she says, this is god's way of challenging her, and she's sworn to herself that she will be strong.<\/p><p>Arwa Damon, CNN, Malalak, Indonesia.<\/p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)<\/p><p>BLITZER: The power of Twitter activists facing serious charges over allegedly using the social networking site to direct protesters at the G-20 summit.<\/p><p>Now, listen up, tweeters and blowers, the federal trait commission is imposing new rules to regulate what's posted online.<\/p><p>BLITZER: Right now, we're learning more about those protests we saw at the G-20 summit last month in Pittsburgh. Two men are being charged for allegedly helping demonstrators evade police using Twitter.<\/p><p>CNN's Brian Todd was there at the G-20. He's now working the story for us. What's going on, Brian?<\/p><p>BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Pennsylvania state police say two men used Twitter and cell phones to avoid getting rounded up after they were given what the police call a \"lawful order to disperse.\"<\/p><p>The attorney for one of them doesn't deny that his client was communicating with protestors, but says he was simply exercising his right to free speech.<\/p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)<\/p><p>TODD: Their confrontations with police were the most dramatic moments of the G-20 summit in Pittsburgh. We were alongside so-called political anarchists during their protests when they were gassed by police. Our CNN crew got caught up in it.<\/p><p>But this was also a highly charged cat-and-mouse game. Block by block, police sealing off streets, protestors shifting direction, adjusting tactics.<\/p><p>Now two of the activists are charged with using cell phones and the social networking Web site Twitter to help protestors avoid getting rounded up by police.<\/p><p>Court documents say just a few miles from where the protests took place, police busted the two men in a hotel room where they say the men were observed sitting in front of computers and maps wearing headphones and microphones. Police scanners were in the room.<\/p><p>But the attorney for one of the men tells CNN the scanners were not being used.<\/p><p>MARTIN STOLAR, ATTORNEY FOR ANARCHIST ELLIOT MADISON: To the extent that anything was broadcast about what the police were doing or what emergency services were doing, that information came from things that the police made available on the Internet. And if that information was then communicated to people who were involved in the demonstrations, it's totally public information.<\/p><p>TODD: Martin Stolar says both men deny wrongdoing. The protest was not sanctioned but Stolar says demonstrators still had a right to be out there and his client had a right to communicate with them. The state's attorney's office wouldn't give a comment on the case.<\/p><p>But the police complaint hints at one small nugget that authorities may use to go after the defendants, that they tried to direct protestors to avoid apprehension after a lawful order to disperse.<\/p><p>JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: You could form a test of whether new communications technologies are instruments of free speech or of illegality.<\/p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)<\/p><p>TODD: Defense Attorney Martin Stolar told us that he will argue that his client's First Amendment right to free speech was violated. Stolar has also filed motions to get some items returned to his client, items taken during a 16-hour search of his home in New York last Thursday.<\/p><p>Among them, communications equipment, gas masks, a sling shot, test tubes in beakers, in addition to things that Stolar says never should have been confiscated, like posters of Lenin and Marx, and even a Curious George stuffed animal. They took a lot of things from these people -- Wolf?<\/p><p>BLITZER: Yes. All right, Brian, thanks very much for that update.<\/p><p>The government has a new set of rules out today to regulate what's posted online. The Federal Trade Commission is targeting the relationship between advertisers and the bloggers who endorse their products.<\/p><p>Let's go to our Internet correspondent Abbi Tatton. She's here. Abbi, what are they posting?<\/p><p>ABBI TATTON, CNN INTERNET REPORTER: This really could be anything. It could be a blogger posting a review of a dishwasher. This one's endorsing frozen pizza.<\/p><p>Whether it's baby shoes or video games, the Federal Trade Commission is now saying in the guidelines today, if you are endorsing it on your blog, you must disclose what you're getting in return, whether that's a free product or compensation from that company.<\/p><p>Now, many of these blogs are already doing this. The ones I showed you, they all state, I got this free, I'm now reviewing it. An influential group of mommy blogs over the summer also got together and said that \"We're going to be upfront with our readers about exactly what's going on behind the scenes.\"<\/p><p>But that the Federal Trade Commission is now involved in this shows what big business this now is. If you're an influential blogger with a lot community of readers, you might be getting pitches several dozen pitches each day from companies who want help selling their products -- Wolf?<\/p><p>BLITZER: How's the FTC, Abbi, going to regulate all this?<\/p><p>TATTON: They admit that this going to be somewhat of a game of whack a mole because there are so many millions of blogs and social media sites out there. Bloggers that ignore the guidelines could get an order to comply.<\/p><p>But an FTC attorney that we spoke to, Richard Cleland, said they're probably more likely to go after the advertisers, to monitor what kind of instructions they're giving the bloggers about what they should be posting on their websites -- Wolf?<\/p><p>BLITZER: Thanks very much, Abbi, for that.

Kolerich kept in constant contact with the WSP regarding the possible outbreak of violence, as well as the possible usage of smart phones to record any actions of the police. <br\/> The emails revealed a clear partnership between the bank and the police to attack one group with a long history of agitating Bank of America.<br\/> Digital Journal contributor Justin King has extensively covered Anonymous. His relationship with the collective does not allow him to get any previous information about a campaign because it would put the collective and himself in jeopardy; however, he views the silence of Anonymous as an ominous sign for Bank of America. <br\/> 'The IRC channels won't even discuss Bank of America- typically what that means is that they are going to do something. If they weren't going to be up to something, they would talk about it more freely.' What could be next for Bank of America is another embarrassing leak that shows culpability in blatantly criminal conduct.<br\/> In February 2013, Anonymous hacked into the private e-mails, and spreadsheets of TEKsystems[2], a contractor hired Bank of America to monitor Anonymous and other hacker networks taking aim at the bank. The information included an email that suggested TEKsystems was able to identify the person behind an Anonymous Twitter handle. That leak, and others have not prevented massive corporations from conducting surveillance programs, because they have friends in high places, who allow corporations to act with impunity.<br\/>Bank of America is part of the Domestic Security Alliance Council[3], a partnership between corporations and the FBI that 'advances elements of the FBI and DHS missions' in preventing, deterring, and investigating criminal and terrorism acts...' The secretive partnership was revealed thanks to a Freedom of Information request by the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund. In the highly redacted documents Bank of America was shown to be working with the FBI, and other federal agencies to spy on Occupy Wall Street protestors. In a release[4] explaining what was found, Executive Director of PCJF, Mara Verheyden- Willard said, 'The documents show that the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security are treating protests against the corporate and banking structure of America as potential criminal and terrorist activity.' Verheyden-Willard added, federal agencies are acting as 'a de-facto intelligence arm,' for corporations and Wall Street, a claim that is not off base.<br\/> In late 2010, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange threatened to take down an American bank. In fear that they were the ones targeted, Bank of America got together with their friends in a quest to discredit and destroy Wikileaks. In the report Spooky Business,[5] author Gary Ruskin noted the bank hired the law firm Hunton Williams to join forces with security companies Palantir Technologies, Berico Technologies, and HB Gary to devise a plan to save BoA by orchestrating 'highly unethical, and\/or illegal tactics,' to ruin the reputation of Wikileaks. Those tactics included submitting false information and calling out the errors to ruin the reputation of leaker, as well as attacking their network to expose the identities of the leakers. The plan even included a plan to destroy the career of journalist Glenn Greenwald, for the crime of supporting Wikileaks.<br\/> In emails leaked by Wikileaks, former head of HB Gary Aaron Burr noted Greenwald was a person the team needed to 'highlight,' because, 'without the support of people like him, Wikileaks would fold.' When media outlets reported on the story, Hunton Williams refused to comment at any time, the D.C powerhouse firm stayed silent in a desperate attempt to avoid responsibility. They have multi-national corporations, banks, and security firms to protect from hackers, protestors, and anyone who attacks unethical practises their clients make a sport out of. Bank of America is only one of those clients, and they are not the only corporation who attack protest.<br\/> The Spooky Business report found, 'Corporations have been linked to a wide variety of espionage tactics. The most prevalent tactic appears to be infiltration by posing a volunteer or journalist, to obtain information from a non-profit.' These activities are practiced by the likes of Monsanto, Kraft, Wal Mart, Shell go to any lengths to silence protest through blackmail, and intimidation. All in an effort to silence concerned Americans who practice freedom of speech and assembly.<br\/> In an interview from Oakland, Ruskin claimed, 'We have so little information on the outbreak of corporate espionage.' Without an Edward Snowden within the apparatus, corporations are able to 'cloak their espionage activities,' in complete secrecy. Even though Ruskin authored a report that shined a light on the practise of corporate spying, his work is only a treatment in an empty book void of pertinent information. In the eyes of Ruskin, 'You have seen no action as far as you can tell, from either Congress, or the Department of Justice regarding wrongdoing by the latest geo-corporate espionage against non profit organizations.' <br\/> When security companies hired by federal agencies, hire former federal agents from the CIA, FBI, and various police forces, the motivation to investigate these operations is non-existent. The American spy state is alive and well. As long as corporate espionage operations remain a dark secret, America's constitutional rights will slowly vanish.<br\/> [1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.scribd.com\/doc\/195106541\/Modified-Redacted-Dorsey-Combined-Emails-PD-13-1055-0357-Removed-Two-Pages-Detailing-Organizers-Home-Address\">http:\/\/www.scribd.com\/doc\/195106541\/Modified-Redacted-Dorsey-Combined-Emails-PD-13-1055-0357-Removed-Two-Pages-Detailing-Organizers-Home-Address<\/url> [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/news.cnet.com\/8301-1009_3-57571955-83\/anonymous-leaks-alleged-data-on-bofa-execs-surveillance\/\">http:\/\/news.cnet.com\/8301-1009_3-57571955-83\/anonymous-leaks-alleged-data-on-bofa-execs-surveillance\/<\/url> [3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.dsac.gov\/Pages\/index.aspx\">http:\/\/www.dsac.gov\/Pages\/index.aspx<\/url> [4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.justiceonline.org\/commentary\/fbi-files-ows.html\">http:\/\/www.justiceonline.org\/commentary\/fbi-files-ows.html<\/url> [5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.corporatepolicy.org\/2013\/11\/20\/spooky-business\/\">http:\/\/www.corporatepolicy.org\/2013\/11\/20\/spooky-business\/<\/url><\/p><p\/><\/body>","1328":"To Stage Worldwide Protests Against GoogleIn an open letter, 90+ Google employees join Amnesty International in calling on Google to cancel Project Dragonfly, its censored search engine for China (Google Employees Against Dragonfly)","803":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Exactly one year ago, Roman Cochet swapped his $500 iPhone 7 for a $30 LG flip phone.

It's just as pleasing to look at as the iPhone, but reduces your apps to a handful, such as calls, messaging, GPS, contacts and ride-hailing. It won't have social media, a browser or email.<\/p><p>More than 4,000 people have preordered the Light Phone 2, according to company CEO Kaiwei Tang. He expects that figure to increase to more than 10,000, which is the number of people who bought the original Light Phone.<\/p><\/body>","635":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">The Free Press issued the following news release:<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Internet users outraged by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to gut Net Neutrality are planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on Thursday, Dec. 7, one week before an expected vote at the FCC. In some cities, protesters will march from Verizon stores to lawmakers' offices.<\/p><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">The protests will highlight the company's role lobbying to kill rules that prevent telecom giants from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what internet users see and do through discriminatory throttling. Protesters will carry signs calling on their members of Congress to speak out against Verizon's attacks on Net Neutrality and publicly oppose the FCC's plan, which is expected to be released this week.<\/p><p>See the website announcing the protests here: VerizonProtests.com<\/p><p>Ajit Pai's plan is expected to contain a \"total repeal\" of Net Neutrality protections, posing a grave threat to the future of freedom of expression, access to information, and small businesses particularly for communities of color and low income communities.<\/p><p>The December 7 protests represent growing grassroots backlash to the FCC's plan, which polls show is wildly unpopular with people from across the political spectrum. The events are supported by Team Internet, a grassroots network of nearly half a million volunteer activists spearheaded by Demand Progress, Fight for the Future, and Free Press Action Fund, three of the groups behind the massive July 12 Net Neutrality day of action that drove millions of comments, emails, and phone calls to the FCC and Congress.<\/p><p>Over recent months the groups behind the protests have organized thousands of constituents to attend more than 600 town halls and meetings with lawmakers to demand their support for Net Neutrality. A phone call campaign through BattleForTheNet.com has generated nearly 250,000 phone calls to legislators offices.<\/p><p>At the protests participants will be encouraged to take a group photo and tweet it at their local members of Congress. Where possible, protesters will march to a nearby lawmaker's office and deliver petition signatures.<\/p><p>Protests are currently planned in Phoenix, Denver, San Francisco, New York City, Indianapolis, Boston, and several other cities across the country. They're being organized by volunteers in a grassroots manner using email, texting, and social media. Local internet users can volunteer to host a protest, and then connect with other volunteers in their area and encourage them to attend. There will be a special protest event in Washington, DC, details are TBA.<\/p><p>\"This is the free speech fight of our generation and internet users are pissed off and paying attention\" said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, \"Ajit Pai may be owned by Verizon, but he has to answer to Congress, and lawmakers have to answer to us, their constituents. The corrupt bureaucrats trying to kill Net Neutrality are hoping to avoid public backlash by burying the news over the Holiday weekend. We're taking our protest from the internet to the streets to make sure that doesn't happen,\" she added.<\/p><p>\"FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has been too busy meeting with industry lobbyists and greedy Verizon executives to hear the outcry from millions of people who are joining together to reject his plan to kill off Net Neutrality,\" said Free Press Action Fund Field Director Mary Alice Crim. \"People know that the open internet is essential for accessing everything from elder care to mental health services and they're willing to fight for it. That's why Team Internet members have met face-to-face with hundreds of members of Congress and their staff, organized others in their communities, and spoken out on behalf of Net Neutrality. This momentum of popular support will spill into the streets on Dec. 7 as people protest Pai and his corporate cronies outside Verizon stores nationwide. Our message to Pai and Verizon is clear: people everywhere will not sit idle as you destroy the free and open internet.\"<\/p><p>\"Americans are sick and tired of lawmakers placing the profits of monopolistic companies like Verizon and Comcast above the interests of ordinary people,\" said Mark Stanley, Director of Communications for Demand Progress. \"Outside Washington, support for strong Net Neutrality is widespread, regardless of political affiliation. Now, with what would be a catastrophic vote by the FCC to repeal Net Neutrality looming, people are ready to take to the streets in protest and to offer Congress one last chance to answer the question: 'Do you stand for your constituents' ability to communicate and connect, or do you stand for Verizon's bottom line?'\"<\/p><p>This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 21, 2017.<\/p><p>Contact: Timothy Karr, 201\/533-8838<\/p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services<\/p><p>MSTRUCK-6083739 MSTRUCK<\/p><\/body>","1368":"Stage nationwide strike against General MotorsEye Opener at 8: Workers stage nationwide strike against General Motors","1062":"Mounts Legal Protest Against PayPalAnonymous Mounts Legal Protest Against PayPal [Hackers]","898":"<body><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\"\/><p xmlns:nitf=\"http:\/\/iptc.org\/std\/NITF\/2006-10-18\/\" nitf:lede=\"true\">Jun 05, 2013 (The Nation's Blogs:<url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.thenation.com\/blogs\">http:\/\/www.thenation.com\/blogs<\/url> Delivered by Newstex)<br\/> Riot police use teargas to disperse the crowd during an anti-government protest at Taksim Square in central Istanbul May 31, 2013. (REUTERS\/Osman Orsal)<br\/>Turkish citizens rising up to protest the policies of Prime Minister <person><nameText>Recep Tayyip Erdogan's <\/nameText><\/person>government have faced arrests[1], water hoses[2], tear gas and in some cases have even been detained[3] for using social media to discuss the demonstrations. And while attention has turned to Turkey's media establishment[4], which has refused to cover much of the protests, another influential group has sat largely on the sidelines: American elected officials.<\/p><p><br\/> While <person><nameText>Vice President Joe Biden <\/nameText><\/person>and some administration officials have criticized[5] Turkey's government and its response to the protests, few lawmakers are raising alarm. A ProQuest news search of the last five days fails to turn up a single story quoting a member of Congress criticizing Erdogan, or his increasingly authoritarian reaction to the protests. Part of the reason might relate to the fact that Turkey is a strong US ally in the region, and lawmakers are hesitant to disturb US-Turkish relations. But the self-imposed silence from American politicians could also be seen as a result of aggressive outreach from the Turkish government, which, since 2007, has retained at least six lobbying firms to shape public opinion and court elected officials.<br\/>Turkey maintains an active effort to fly lawmakers to visit the country. Though Congress banned foreign-funded travel in years past, many foreign entities set up nonprofit organizations to organize 'Mutual Education and Cultural Exchange Act' (MECEA) trips for elected officials to legally visit[6] foreign destinations on the nonprofit's dime. Lawmakers and officials of both parties regularly attend events organized by Turkey's government.<br\/> The website LegiStorm, which collects congressional data, shows that in the last twelve months, Representatives Henry Cuellar, Aaron Schock, Mo Brooks and Jan Scharkowsky, along with dozens of staff, have visited Istanbul through trips sponsored by Turkish MECEA groups. The visits to Turkey are so routine that last weekend, a delegation[7] of state-level lawmakers from New Mexico even witnessed some of the demonstrations. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker, along with a bipartisan group of lawmakers, have been featured at press events[8] with Turkish government officials in Washington DC this year.<br\/> The MECEA trips and congressional ceremonies have been organized by staffers from Turkey's various lobbying firms, according to filing with the Department of Justice's FARA website. Turkey's government pays two former Democratic Congressmen, Dick Gephardt[9] (through his corporate lobbying firm, the Gephardt Group) and Al Wynn[10] (through his law firm, Dickstein Shapiro), to influence Washington. Others on the payroll include David Mercer[11], a prominent Democratic aide[12], a team of about twenty[13] from the firm PR giant Fleischman-Hillard, 30 Point Strategies and the Caspian Group[14]. Some of the MECEA-organizing nonprofits also retain[15] influential lobbying consultants, like the firm Brown, Lloyd and James (known for previously representing Muammar Qaddafi and Bashar al-Assad's wife[16]).<br\/> Please support our journalism. Get a digital subscription for just $9.50![17]<br\/> The ties between US corporations and the Turkish government are another potential reason lawmakers have been slow to show solidarity with the protesters. Business and diplomacy are on display at the Turkish American Council, one of the most influential Turkish nonprofit geared toward congressional outreach. The council is funded by[18] the Turkish government's investment agency and a number of corporations with economic interests in Turkey, including Lockheed Martin (makers of the F-35, which is partially assembled[19] in Turkey), TUSKON (a Turkish business lobby group) and Chevron (which maintains major drillings[20] interests in the Black Sea).<br\/> At its annual conference this week at the Washington DC Ritz-Carlton, the American Turkish Council discussed US-Turkish relations with corporate executives and political leaders from the two countries. Biden received an award, as did House Homeland Security Committee Chair Representative Mike Rogers, according to a schedule posted online[21].<br\/> Read Allison Kilkenny[22] on the groups showing

But there are some special, shining cases where the status update has been used to do some extraordinary things, from marriage proposals to breaking news, and much more.<\/p><p><br\/><br\/>The following are 10 of the most extraordinary and creative uses of Twitter updates. These amazing updates have made the news, pushed the boundaries of what the status update can do, and have even fundamentally changed peoples lives.<br\/><br\/><url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/budurl.com\/ttmashable\"\/>This post is part of a Mashable mini-series providing analysis of social medias smallest big trend: the status update. The series is supported by the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/budurl.com\/ttmashable\">TurboTax SuperStatus Contest<\/url>, which invites you to win up to $25K for an interesting Twitter or Facebook message.<br\/>  1. The marriage proposal  <br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>On May 28th, Max Kiesler asked Emily Chang for her       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/maxkiesler\/statuses\/774352312\">hand in marriage<\/url>. And with three little words, she       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/emilychang\/statuses\/774352570\">accepted his proposal<\/url>.<br\/><br\/>Yes, in two little status updates, a couple got engaged. Even the Mashable team       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/2008\/03\/21\/max-emily-twitter-proposal\/\">was a little stunned<\/url>. What a way for two social media lovers to become forever connected. The bonus was that thousands of people got to be part of their special moment.<br\/><br\/>Others have gotten engaged using Twitter, including       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/garazi\/statuses\/765929392\">@garazi to @stefsull<\/url> and earlier this year,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/grobertson\/status\/1104743086\">@grobertson to @film_girl<\/url>.<br\/>  2. Tweeting from the womb  <br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>When is it too early to let your kids tweet? Well, if youre Corey Menschers kid, its never too early. Coreys kid was tweeting at 6 months\u00a6.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/2008\/12\/14\/baby-twitter\/\">before he was even born<\/url>. Corey created a device and a Twitter account,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/kickbee\">kickbee<\/url>, which sent out tweets anytime the kid (Tyler) kicked his mom. <br\/><br\/>Tyler, born on January 19th, 2009, now \u0153tweets from his new account,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/minimensch\">minimensch<\/url>.<br\/><br\/>This extraordinary use of Twitter updates to track baby development is just one example of extraordinarily       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/2008\/11\/07\/twitterthings-objects-tweet\/\">unique applications of status updates<\/url> that people have developed.<br\/>  3. The tweet from Mars  <br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>When ice was found on Mars, how did the news break? By the New York Times? No. By the TV news networks? No. A blog? Wrong again. The news broke that ice was discovered on Mars       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MarsPhoenix\/statuses\/839088619\">by the Twitter account<\/url> of the Mars Phoenix Lander. <br\/><br\/>The       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/marsphoenix\">Mars Phoenix Lander<\/url> was a NASA JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) vessel designed to collect information on Mars, specifically whether or not it could support life or even if it has life on it now. The NASA JPL team sent out status updates as the Phoenix Lander, talking about what it found on the 4th planet from the sun. The response was overwhelming, with tens of thousands of followers and increased visibility for the Mars mission and Twitter.<br\/><br\/>The Mars Phoneix Lander is truly the first to post status updates from another world.<br\/>  4. Status updates for a worthy cause  <br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>Can people change the world for the better in 140 characters? The answer is a clear and definitive yes. Not only can they change the world, but they already have, by mobilizing people towards worthy causes.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/twestival.com\/\">Twestival<\/url> was a worldwide event on February 12th to bring Tweeters together and raise money for Charity: Water (and a cause we were       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/2009\/01\/26\/twestival-mashable\/\">proud to support<\/url>). The result of all of these tweets?       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/2009\/02\/18\/twestival-results\/\">Over $250,000 raised<\/url> for clean water across the globe.<br\/><br\/>This is not the only charity event held through Twitter.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/tweetsgiving.org\/\">Tweetsgiving<\/url> raised $10,000 to build a classroom in Tanzania and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/tweetathon2009.com\/\">Tweet-a-thon<\/url> was a 12-hour marathon of video and tweeting that raised money for Water is Life. Its clear that the status update can drive people to come together and give a piece of themselves for a greater cause.<br\/>  5. The Egyptian arrest case  <br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>On April 10th, 2008,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jamesbuck\">James Karl Buck<\/url> and his translator       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2008\/TECH\/04\/25\/twitter.buck\/\">were arrested<\/url> by the Egyptian police while covering an anti-government protest. James, a grad student from Berkeley, was able to tweet one word while being taken away by Egyptian authorities:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jamesbuck\/statuses\/786571964\">Arrested<\/url>. This one update sparked his friends and followers into action, eventually leading to his university hiring a lawyer on his behalf and his release a day later.<br\/><br\/>This is proof that one update, even if its a single word, can mobilize people to action and change the course of events.<br\/>  6. Breaking the news first  <br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>It can take hours to write a good news article or blog post, 30 minutes to write a breaking news article, and even 5 minutes to write a couple lines to break the story. With status updates, it takes a matter of seconds. This has enabled Twitter to break news even before the news stations. <br\/><br\/>Since just one example wont suffice, here are several:<br\/><br\/> Plane crash: When a Continental Airlines (NYSE:CAL)  737 crashed into the ground in Denver, Colorado, the news media       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/2008\/12\/21\/denver-plane-crash\/\">werent the first to break it<\/url> - passenger Mike Wilson was the first       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/2drinksbehind\/status\/1069832870\">to tell the tale.<\/url><br\/><br\/>Earthquake in China: On May 12th, 2008, China was rocked by a magnitude 7.8 earthquake. Who broke the story first?       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/blogs\/technology\/2008\/05\/twitter_and_the_china_earthqua.html\">Users on Twitter<\/url>.<br\/><br\/>Terrorism in Mumbai: When horrendous terrorist attacks gripped the city of Mumbai in India, Tweeters were once again the first       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2008\/WORLD\/asiapcf\/11\/27\/mumbai.twitter\/\">to break the news<\/url>. Some of the tweets were heart-wrenching, but ensured       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/2008\/11\/27\/twitter-search-mumbai\/\">we all knew<\/url> what was happening. <br\/><br\/>The status update fundamentally impacted how news is broken and tracked by the public.<br\/>  7. The job offer  <br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>Twitter is a great place to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/2009\/03\/13\/twitter-jobs\/\">find a job<\/url>, but RedMonk, an open-source analyst and consulting firm, took things a step further when it offered       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TomRaftery\">Tom Raftery<\/url> a full-time position at the company\u00a6via a Twitter update. He       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TomRaftery\/statuses\/818265150\">accepted the offer<\/url>. <br\/><br\/>Its extraordinary how a few tweets can land people jobs.<br\/>  8. Preventing Tragedy  <br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>On April 3rd, 2009, there was a scare when a woman sent a tweet threatening suicide to actress and frequent Twitter user       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mrskutcher\">Demi Moore<\/url>.<br\/><br\/>Moores response?       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mrskutcher\/status\/1444493267\">Hope you are joking<\/url>, followed by a retweet of the message. Her thousands of followers quickly pinpointed the probable location of the woman and alerted authorities, who brought her in for hospitalization and psychological evaluation.<br\/><br\/>Its not just about the extraordinary tweet, but about the reaction and mobilization a 140 character string can spark.<br\/>  9. The John McCain interview  <br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>Interviews tend to be long-winded affairs, and can be even longer when a politician is the one being interviewed. How do you cut the interview down to the meat and bones, without all of the frills and political jargon? By limiting questions and responses to 140 characters, of course.<br\/><br\/>On March 17th, ABC Newss       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/GStephanopoulos\">George Stephanopoulos<\/url> interviewed       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/senjohnmccain\">Senator John McCain<\/url> on Iraq, the economy, and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SenJohnMcCain\/status\/1342997135\">his family<\/url> via Twitter @reply messages. The interview was a unique experiment in many respects: answers had to be brief and thousands of people would be watching in real-time.<br\/><br\/>The experiment is in the books, but as more and more people look to Twitter for information, expect more Twinterviews and other great experiments utilizing the constraints of the status update.<br\/>  10. The first update  <br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>Of course, none of these extraordinary updates would be possible if it werent for the first Twitter update and for the innovations that made it possible. <br\/><br\/>The       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jack\/status\/20\">first Twitter status update<\/url> ever sent on March 21st, 2006 by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. <br\/>  Extraordinary status updates: Whats in store?  <br\/>Its hard to believe that the status update is only a few years old. But in that time span, millions of people have updated their status billions of times. As social media grows more and more popular, the status update will be central in how our culture interacts and grows.<br\/><br\/>Have more extraordinary Twitter updates to bring to our attention?
